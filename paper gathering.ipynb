The objective of this study was to assess the impact of SDG on rumen fermentation using an in vitro rumen simulation technology. Additionally, we tested the effects of SDG (0.20\\u2009g\\u2009kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight) on rumen development and production performance of lambs in a production setting.\",\n",

Feeding trials revealed that SDG significantly increased average daily feed intake and average daily weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and reduced the acetate/propionate ratio (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

      "                    \"Hematological and neurological expressed 1 (HN1) is homolog of Jupiter protein from Drosophila melanogaster where it functions as a microtubule-associated protein. However, in mammalian cells, HN1 is associated partially with y-tubulin in centrosomes, Stathmin for stabilizing microtubules, and Cdh1 for regulating Cyclin B1 for cell cycle regulation. Moreover, HN1 overexpression leads to early mitotic exit as well. Other molecular functions and interactions of HN1 are not clear yet. Here, based on our previous analysis where HN1 was shown to cluster supernumerary centrosomes and maintain mitotic spindle assembly, we further investigated the role of HN1 in centrosome maintenance and mitotic fidelity in PC-3 prostate and MDA-MB231 mammary cancer cell lines. The maturation-associated roles of HN1 during cell division by examining the AuroraA-PLK1 axis involving a plus end kinesin, Eg5 as well as pericentriolar matrix protein (PCM1) as components of centrosomes were established. We found that HN1 co-localized to centrioles with Eg5 and Aurora A to suppress aberrant spindle formation to ensure the fidelity of centriole/centrosome duplication when overexpressed. Consistently, depleting the HN1 expression using siRNA or shRNA resulted in an increased number of dysregulated mitotic spindle structures, where Aurora A as well as PLK1 co-localizations with Eg5 and PCM1 were disrupted. Further, the PLK1 and Aurora A kinase's phosphorylations also decreased, confirming the hypothesis that the cells struggle in mitotic progression, display nuclear and cytokinetic abnormalities with supernumerary but immature mononucleated centrosomes. In summary, we described the role of HN1 in centrosome nucleation/maturation in PLK1-Eg5 axis and concomitant mitotic spindle formation in human cells.\"\n",

      "                    \"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe injury to the central nervous system, and its treatment is always a major medical challenge. Proinflammatory cell death is considered an important factor affecting neuroinflammation and the prognosis after injury. PANoptosis, a newly discovered type of proinflammatory cell death, regulates the activation of executioner molecules of apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis through the PANoptosome, providing a new target for therapeutic intervention after SCI. However, its role and regulatory mechanism in SCI are not yet elucidated. Here, based on proteomic data, YBX1 expression is significantly increased in neurons after SCI. Guided by RIP-seq, subsequent experiments reveal that YBX1 promotes ZBP1 expression by stabilizing the Zbp1 mRNA, thereby aggravating ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis. Furthermore, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM56 is identified as an endogenous inhibitor of YBX1 via molecular docking and IP/MS analysis. Mechanistically, TRIM56 bound to YBX1 and promoted its ubiquitination, thereby accelerating its degradation. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel function of YBX1 in regulating ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis in the pathogenesis of SCI and verified that TRIM56 functions as an endogenous inhibitor to promote the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of YBX1, providing new insights into SCI treatment strategies.\"\n",

      "                    \"Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) differentiate into periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and cementoblasts. To identify inducers of PDL fibroblastic differentiation, monoclonal antibody series were developed a series of against membrane/extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules through decoy immunization. The anti-PDL13 antibody targets ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), renowned for regulating skeletal and soft tissue mineralization. ENPP1 accumulates in the periodontal ligament region of tooth roots, and specifically localizes to the cell boundaries and elongated processes of the fibroblastic cells. As ENPP1 expression increases during fibroblastic differentiation, mineralization induced by tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), a pyrophosphate-degrading enzyme, is completely inhibited. This is consistent with ENPP1 and TNAP acting in opposition, and TGF-\\u03b21-induced ENPP1 expression creates an essential environment for PDL fibroblast differentiation. Representative fibroblastic differentiation markers decrease with endogenous ENPP1 inhibition by siRNA and antibody blocking. ENPP2 generates lipid signaling molecules. In contrast to ENPP1, ENPP2 disappears in TGF-\\u03b21-induced PDL fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of <i>ENPP2</i> hinders TGF-\\u03b21-induced PDL fibroblastic differentiation. Suppression of ENPP1 and ENPP2 leads to severe defects in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, demonstrating that these two factors play opposing roles in soft and hard tissue differentiation but can complement each other for cell survival. In conclusion, increased ENPP1 is crucial for TGF-\\u03b21-induced PDL differentiation, while ENPP2 and TNAP can inhibit ENPP1. ENPP1 and ENPP2 exhibit complementary functions in the cell survival.\"\n",

      "                    \"SARS-CoV-2 infection increases systemic inflammatory cytokines which act as a second-hit driver of Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)-mediated collapsing glomerulopathy. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination also increases cytokines. Recent reports of new glomerular disease in individuals with <i>APOL1</i> high-risk genotype (HRG) following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination raised the concern SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may also act as a second-hit driver of APOL1-mediated glomerulopathy.\",\n",
      "                    \"We screened 1507 adults in the Duke's Measurement to Understand Reclassification of Disease of Cabarrus and Kannapolis (MURDOCK) registry and enrolled 105 eligible participants with available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data, prevaccination and postvaccination serum creatinine, and urine protein measurements. Paired data were stratified by number of APOL1 risk alleles (RAs) and compared within groups using Wilcoxon signed rank test and across groups by analysis of variance.\",\n",
      "                    \"Among 105 participants, 30 (28.6%) had 2, 39 (37.1%) had 1, and 36 (34.3%) had 0 APOL1 RA. Most of the participants (94%) received at least 2 doses of vaccine. Most (98%) received the BNT162B2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. On average, the prevaccine and postvaccine laboratory samples were drawn 648 days apart. There were no detectable differences between pre- and post-serum creatinine or pre- and post-urine albumin creatinine ratio irrespective of the participants' APOL1 genotype. Finally, most participants with APOL1 RA had the most common haplotype (E150, I228, and K255) and lacked the recently described protective N264K haplotype.\",\n",
      "                    \"In this observational study, <i>APOL1</i> HRG is not associated with new or worsening of proteinuria or decline in kidney function following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Validation of this result in larger cohorts would further support the renal safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in individuals with APOL1 HRG.\"\n",

      "                    \"Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is an RNA methyltransferase that catalyzes the <i><i>N<sup>6</sup></i> </i> -methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA in eukaryotic cells. Past studies have shown that METTL3 is highly expressed in various cancers and is closely related to tumor development. Therefore, METTL3 inhibitors have received widespread attention as effective treatments for different types of tumors. This study proposes a hybrid high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) protocol that combines structure-based methods with geometric deep learning-based DeepDock algorithms. We identified unique skeleton inhibitors of METTL3 from our self-built internal database. Among them, compound <b>C3</b> showed significant inhibitory activity on METTL3, and further molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide more details about the binding conformation. Overall, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of hybrid virtual algorithms, which is of great significance for understanding the biological functions of METTL3 and developing treatment methods for related diseases.\"\n",

      "                    \"GSE38974 and GSE106986 were used to select DEGs in COPD samples and normal samples. Cytoscape software was used to construct and present protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, mRNA-miRNA co-expression network and ceRNA network. The CIBERSORT algorithm and the Lasso model were used to screen the immune infiltrating cells and hub genes associated with COPD, and the correlation between them was analyzed. COPD cell models were constructed <i>in vitro</i> and the expression level of ceRNA network factors mediated by hub gene was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).\",\n",

Gene clustering analysis of PPI network results was performed using the Minimum Common Tumor Data Element (MCODE) in Cytoscape, and seven hub genes were screened using five algorithms in cytoHubba. CCL20 was verified as an important hub gene based on mRNA-miRNA co-expression network, GSE106986 database validation and the analysis of ROC curve results. Finally, we successfully constructed the circDTL-hsa-miR-330-3p-CCL20 network by Cytoscape. Immune infiltration analysis suggested that CCL20 can co-regulate immune cell migration and infiltration through chemokines CCL7 and CXCL3. <i>In vitro</i> experiments, the expression of circDTL and CCL20 was increased, while the expression of hsa-miR-330-3p was decreased in the COPD cell model.\",\n",

      "                    \"Oligonucleotide-based therapy has experienced remarkable development in the past 2 decades, but its broad applications are severely hampered by delivery vectors. Widely used viral vectors and lipid nanovectors are suffering from immune clearance after repeating usage or requiring refrigerated transportation and storage, respectively. In this work, amino-modified virus-mimetic spike silica nanoparticles (NH<sub>2</sub>-SSNs) were fabricated using a 1-pot surfactant-free approach with controlled spike lengths, which were demonstrated with excellent delivery performance and biosafety in nearly all cell types and mice. It indicated that NH<sub>2</sub>-SSNs entered cells by spike-dependent cell membrane docking and dynamin-dependent endocytosis. The positively charged spikes with proper length on the surface can facilitate the efficient encapsulation of RNAs, protect the loaded RNAs from degradation, and trigger an early endosome escape during intracellular trafficking, similarly to the cellular internalization mechanism of virions. Regarding the fantastic properties of NH<sub>2</sub>-SSNs in nucleic acid delivery, it revealed that nanoparticles with solid spikes on the surface would be excellent vehicles for gene therapy, presenting self-evident advantages in storage, transportation, modification, and quality control in large-scale production compared to lipid nanovectors.\"\n",

      "                    \"This study was aimed to investigate the effects of dietary calcitriol or quercetin supplementation on eggshell and bone quality of laying hens. In trial 1, 72 Hy-Line Brown layers (80-week-old) with weak-shelled strength (25 to 30\\u00a0N) were assigned into 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicates of 3 birds and fed a basal diet (4% calcium level) or basal diets supplemented with 0.5% calcium, 5\\u00a0\\u03bcg/kg calcitriol or 500\\u00a0mg/kg quercetin for 4 weeks. In trial 2, 360 Hy-Line Brown layers (60-week-old) were divided into 3 groups with 8 replicates of 15 birds: control group (basal diet), calcitriol group (basal diet\\u00a0+\\u00a05\\u00a0\\u03bcg/kg calcitriol), and quercetin group (basal diet\\u00a0+\\u00a0500\\u00a0mg/kg quercetin). This trial lasted for 12 weeks. The results showed that dietary calcitriol or quercetin improved eggshell quality in both trials (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05). In trial 2, compared with the control group, both calcitriol and quercetin supplementations improved femoral bone quality, calcium retention of hens and calcium content in uterine fluid at 18.5\\u00a0h post-oviposition (PO) (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05), along with enhancing uterine morphology. Compared to the control group, supplemental calcitriol or quercetin up-regulated the relative mRNA expression levels of uterine transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 6 (<i>TRPV6</i>) at 8.5\\u00a0h PO and plasma membrane calcium-ATPase (<i>PMCA</i>), vitamin D receptor (<i>VDR</i>), estrogen receptor alpha (<i>ER\\u03b1</i>) at 18.5\\u00a0h PO (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05), but down-regulated the uterine caspase 3 (<i>CASP3</i>) relative mRNA expression level at 8.5\\u00a0h PO (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05). Meanwhile, the femoral relative mRNA expression levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (<i>TRAP</i>) (up-regulated at 8.5 and 18.5\\u00a0h PO) and alkaline phosphatase (<i>ALP</i>) (up-regulated at 8.5\\u00a0h PO but down-regulated at 18.5\\u00a0h PO) were also affected by calcitriol or quercetin supplementation (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05). Compared to the calcitriol, quercetin increased hen-day egg production and femoral medullary bone volume/bone tissue volume but reduced femoral stiffness (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05), which were accompanied by increased relative mRNA expression levels of uterine <i>TRPV6</i>, estrogen receptor beta (<i>ER\\u03b2</i>) at 18.5\\u00a0h PO (<i>P</i>\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05). Overall, both dietary calcitriol and quercetin could improve eggshell and bone quality by modulating calcium metabolism of aged layers. Compared to calcitriol, dietary quercetin up-regulated the expression of uterine calcium transporters, without affecting eggshell quality.\"\n",

      "                    \"The progressive degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is accompanied by the formation of a broad array of cytoplasmic and nuclear neuronal inclusions (protein aggregates) largely containing RNA-binding proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) or fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS). This process is driven by a liquid-to-solid phase separation generally from proteins in membrane-less organelles giving rise to pathological biomolecular condensates. The formation of these protein aggregates suggests a fundamental alteration in the mRNA expression or the levels of the proteins involved. Considering the role of the epigenome in gene expression, alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNAs, and RNA modifications become highly relevant to understanding how this pathological process takes effect. In this review, we explore the evidence that links epigenetic mechanisms with the formation of protein aggregates in ALS. We propose that a greater understanding of the role of the epigenome and how this inter-relates with the formation of pathological LLPS in ALS will provide an attractive therapeutic target.\"\n",

Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the outcome of a medically attended PASC diagnosis within 6 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the interaction between vaccination status and prevalent variant at the time of infection and between vaccination status and hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\",\n",

A diagnosis of PASC was associated with older age, female sex, hospitalization for the initial infection, and an increased severity-weighted comorbidity index and was inversely associated with infection during the Omicron period. No difference in the development of diagnosed PASC was observed between unvaccinated patients and those vaccinated with either 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine or >2 doses.\",\n",

      "                    \"High-temperature (HT) stress can induce male sterility in wheat; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study examined proteomic alterations across three developmental stages between normal and HT-induced male-sterile (HT-ms) anthers in wheat. Utilizing tandem mass tags-based proteomics, we identified 2532 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs): 27 in the tetrad stage, 157 in the binuclear stage, and 2348 in the trinuclear stage. Analyses through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways indicated significant enrichment of these DAPs in seven pathways, namely phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, response to heat, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results indicated the downregulation of DAPs associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism, which aligns with anther indehiscence and the lack of starch in HT-ms anthers. By contrast, DAPs in the ROS pathway were upregulated, which aligns with excessive ROS accumulation in HT-ms anthers. Additionally, we conducted protein-protein interaction analysis for the DAPs of these pathways, identifying 15 hub DAPs. The abundance of these hub proteins was confirmed through qRT-PCR, assessing mRNA expression levels of the corresponding transcripts. Collectively, these results offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HT-induced male sterility in wheat at the proteomic level, providing a valuable resource for further research in plant sexual reproduction.\"\n",

      "                    \"Ischaemic stroke is a leading cause of death and severe disability worldwide. Given the importance of protein synthesis in the inflammatory response and neuronal repair and regeneration after stroke, and that proteins are acquired by ribosomal translation of mRNA, it has been theorised that ribosome biogenesis may have an impact on promoting and facilitating recovery after stroke. However, the relationship between stroke and ribosome biogenesis has not been investigated.\",\n",
      "                    \"In the present study, a ribosome biogenesis gene signature (RSG) was developed using Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. We classified ischaemic stroke patients into high-risk and low-risk groups using the obtained relevant genes, and further elucidated the immune infiltration of the disease using ssGSEA, which clarified the close relationship between ischaemic stroke and immune subgroups. The concentration of related proteins in the serum of stroke patients was determined by ELISA, and the patients were divided into groups to evaluate the effect of the ribosome biogenesis gene on patients.

      "                    \"We obtained a set of 12 ribosome biogenesis-related genes (EXOSC5, MRPS11, MRPS7, RNASEL, RPF1, RPS28, C1QBP, GAR1, GRWD1, PELP1, UTP, ERI3), which play a key role in assessing the prognostic risk of ischaemic stroke. Importantly, risk grouping using ribosome biogenesis-related genes was also closely associated with important signaling pathways in stroke. ELISA detected the expression of C1QBP, RPS28 and RNASEL proteins in stroke patients, and the proportion of neutrophils was significantly increased in the high-risk group.\",\n",

      "                    \"Immunotherapy using inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-\\u03b1, has been clinically validated in treating various cancers. However, systemic immunocytokine-based therapies are limited by the short half-life of recombinant proteins and severe dose-limiting toxicities. In this study, we exploited local immunotherapy by intratumoral administration of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA cocktail encoding cytokines IL-12, IL-7, and IFN-\\u03b1. The cytokine mRNA cocktail induced tumor regression in multiple syngeneic mouse models and anti-tumor immune memory in one syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, immune checkpoint blockade further enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of the cytokine mRNAs. Furthermore, human cytokine mRNAs exhibited robust anti-tumor efficacy in humanized mouse tumor models. Mechanistically, cytokine mRNAs induced tumor microenvironment inflammation, characterized by robust T cell infiltration and significant inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production.\"\n",

We included patients \\u226430 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of acute myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination based on clinical presentation, abnormal biomarkers and/or cardiovascular imaging findings. Demographics, past medical history, hospital course, biochemistry results, cardiovascular imaging, and follow-up information from April 2021 to November 2022 were collected. The primary outcome was presence of myocardial injury as evidenced by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.\",\n",

Their initial clinical course was more likely to be mild (80% vs. 23%, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001) and cardiac dysfunction was less common (17% vs. 68%, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.0001), compared to MIS-C. In contrast, LGE on CMR was more prevalent in C-VAM (82% vs. 16%, p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001). The probability of LGE was higher in males (OR 3.28 [95% CI: 0.99, 10.6, p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.052]), in older patients (>15 years, OR 2.74 [95% CI: 1.28, 5.83, p\\u00a0=\\u00a00.009]) and when C-VAM occurred after the first or second dose as compared to the third dose of mRNA vaccine. Mid-term clinical outcomes of C-VAM at a median follow-up of 178\\u00a0days (IQR 114-285 days) were reassuring. No cardiac deaths or heart transplantations were reported until the time of submission of this report. LGE persisted in 60% of the patients at follow up.\",\n",

      "                    \"Given that numerous genetic disorders, driven by diverse pathogenic mechanisms, may be amenable to recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-delivered gene therapies, the sustained innovation of rAAV-based therapeutic modalities is crucial. The progression and severity of genetic diseases can be reduced by targeting the toxic transcripts of a defective gene using microRNA (miRNA)-based miQURE technology delivered within an AAV vector. By adapting the delivered cassette, it may be possible to simultaneously regulate the expression profile of multiple genes involved in the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases. The established miQURE gene silencing strategy was expanded by concatenating several miQURE molecules in a single construct, resulting in the novel linQURE platform. Here, a proof of mechanism is established by demonstrating that linQURE technology enables the concomitant expression of two synthetic miRNAs <i>in\\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\\u00a0vivo</i>, allowing more efficient downregulation of their disease-causing mRNA targets. This approach supports the development of multi-targeting therapeutic strategies, enabling gene therapy products to adapt to more complex multigenic indications, thus expanding the toolbox of readily available gene therapies.\"\n",

      "                    \"Sex hormones are necessary for the development and functions of the normal prostate as well as for the initiation and progression of prostate tumors. Indeed, androgens and estrogens can activate their respective nuclear receptors to modulate the expression of multiple genes and pathways in prostate cells. Nevertheless, the androgen and estrogen responses in the normal prostate, and the transcriptomic changes occurring after carcinogenesis, remain poorly understood. Here, wildtype mice and transgenic mice that spontaneously develop prostate cancer (C57BL/6J PB-Cre4<sup>+/-</sup>;<i>Pten</i> <sup>fl/fl</sup>) were castrated to ensure hormone deprivation. After three days, animals received injections of testosterone and/or estradiol. After one day, the prostates were harvested, and RNA was purified for sequencing. Sequencing data were then analyzed to study transcriptional modulations following hormonal exposures in normal and tumoral murine prostates. New analyses can be carried out with specific fold-change thresholds for gene expression, or with different pair-wise combinations between conditions (treatments and/or mouse models). Together, the data generated herein are a useful tool to study hormonal transcriptional responses in prostate and prostate cancer biology.\"\n",

      "                    \"Nitrogen mustard (NM) is a chemotherapeutic agent capable of alkylating nucleophilic proteins and DNA, causing severe cell damage. However, no reports have been on the dynamic changes in proteomics induced by NM. In this study, we established a model of acute exposure to NM for 1\\u00a0h and a continuous cultured model for 24\\u00a0h after NM removal (repair stage) using 16HBE cells. The nuclear protein spectrum and nuclear proteins crosslinked with DNA were analyzed, and the function of p97 during NM damage was examined. An hour of NM exposure resulted in severe changes in the nuclear protein spectrum and protein into the cell nucleus, which is mainly involved in nuclear acid-related issues. After 24\\u00a0h, the return to normal process of the types and amounts of differentially expressed proteins was inhibited by si-p97. The main processes involved in si-p97 intervention were nucleocytoplasmic transport, processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, metabolic abnormalities, and DNA-response; however. An hour of exposure to NM increased DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC), total-H2AX, and p-H2AX. In contrast, si-p97 only further increased or maintained their levels at 24\\u00a0h yet not at 1\\u00a0h. The effect of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was similar to that of si-p97. The siRNA of DVC1, a partner of p97, also increased the DPC content. Both si-p97 and si-DVC1 increased the cytoplasmic levels of the proteasome (PSMD2). These results suggest acute NM exposure induces severe nuclear protein spectral changes, rapid protein influx into the nucleus, DPC formation, and DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, our data indicated that p97 is involved in normal protein spectrum maintenance and DPC removal after NM withdrawal, requiring the participation of DVC1 and the proteasome.\"\n",

      "                    \"Tumor recurrence and metastasis remain formidable challenges in clinical oncology. Although surgery is an effective treatment for early-stage solid tumors, residual cancer cells can lead to subsequent recurrence or metastasis. Conventional treatments for melanoma, such as anti-tumor medications and gene therapy, have distinct limitations. The rapid systemic distribution of anti-tumor drugs poses a significant challenge, often resulting in notable side effects and inadequate drug concentrations at the tumor site. Melanoma (MM), a deadly form of skin cancer, is known for its high mortality rate. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for treating MM by combining the controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs encapsulated within Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and liposomes with gene therapy targeting Minichromosome Maintenance Proteins 4 (MCM4) using electrospinning and surface modification techniques. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results confirmed that this hierarchical membrane system can effectively deliver therapeutic MCM4 siRNA and release cisplatin to inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MCM4 silencing promoted the sensitivity of melanoma cells to ferroptosis both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The proposed strategy, by allowing for a controlled and sustained release of medication, could alleviate the challenges in drug delivery and aid in prevent tumor recurrence.\"\n",

      "                    \"Antiviral responses induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) include RNA interference (RNAi) and pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), but their relative contributions to antiviral defence are not well understood. We aimed at testing the impact of exogenous applied dsRNA on both layers of defence against potato virus X expressing GFP (PVX-GFP) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Co-inoculation of PVX-GFP with either sequence-specific (RNAi) or nonspecific dsRNA (PTI) showed that nonspecific dsRNA reduced virus accumulation in both inoculated and systemic leaves. However, nonspecific dsRNA was a poor inducer of antiviral immunity compared to a sequence-specific dsRNA capable of triggering the RNAi response, and plants became susceptible to systemic infection. Studies with a PVX mutant unable to move from cell to cell indicated that the interference with PVX-GFP triggered by nonspecific dsRNA operated at the single-cell level. Next, we performed RNA-seq analysis to examine similarities and differences in the transcriptome triggered by dsRNA alone or in combination with viruses harbouring sequences targeted or not by dsRNA. Enrichment analysis showed an over-representation of plant-pathogen signalling pathways, such as calcium, ethylene and MAPK signalling, which are typical of antimicrobial PTI. Moreover, the transcriptomic response to the virus targeted by dsRNA had a greater impact on defence than the non-targeted virus, highlighting qualitative differences between sequence-specific RNAi and nonspecific PTI responses. Together, these results further our understanding of plant antiviral defence, particularly the contribution of nonspecific dsRNA-mediated PTI. We envisage that both sequence-specific RNAi and nonspecific PTI pathways may be triggered via topical application of dsRNA, contributing cumulatively to plant protection against viruses.\"\n",

      "                    \"N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>Am), a common mRNA modification in eukaryotic capped mRNAs, plays a pivotal role in cellular functions and disease progression. However, its involvement in host inflammation remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that loss of m<sup>6</sup>Am methyltransferase phosphorylated CTD interacting factor 1 (PCIF1) attenuates periodontal inflammation in whole-body and myeloid lineage-specific knockout mouse models. <i>Pcif1</i> deletion inhibits macrophage phagocytosis and migration through m<sup>6</sup>Am-Csf1r signaling. In addition, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is identified as a potential target for the treatment of periodontitis. We thus reveal a previously unrecognized role for PCIF1-mediated m<sup>6</sup>Am modification in governing macrophage responses and periodontal inflammation.\"\n",

A total of 483 patients diagnosed with BS in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Peking University People's Hospital from 2019 to 2022 were enrolled. The baseline information and clinical features of the patients were recorded at their first diagnosis and tested the level of HLA-B51, several auto-antibodies, antistreptolysin-O(ASO), immune globulin, complement in blood serum and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation of biomarkers and phenotypes. <b>Results:</b> Among BS patients, the number of positive cases for HLA-B51, anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and ASO was 129, 115, 79 and 54, respectively. The positive rate of other biomarkers was less than 5.0%. About 12.6% of patients with BS had an increased level of IgA (<i>n</i>=61), and 10.8% of patients had an increased level of IgG (<i>n</i>=52). About 41.0% of patients had increased levels of IL-6 (<i>n</i>=198), and 6.4% of patients had decreased levels of IgM (<i>n</i>=31). About 11.2% of patients had decreased levels of C3 (<i>n</i>=54), and 6.0% of patients had decreased levels of C4 (<i>n</i>=29). Elevated IgA was a risk factor for the articular phenotype of BS (<i>OR</i>=2.652, <i>P</i>=0.011). Decreased complement C4 was a risk factor for the neurological phenotype of BS (<i>OR</i>=3.594, <i>P</i>=0.039). Positive ASO was a risk factor for the gastrointestinal phenotype of BS (<i>OR</i>=2.578, <i>P</i>=0.041). Elevated IL-6 was a risk factor for the ocular phenotype of BS (<i>OR</i>=7.560, <i>P</i>=0.016). <b>Conclusion:</b> HLA-B51 and AECA are common biomarkers in BS. Elevated IgA, decreased complement C4, positive ASO, and elevated IL-6 are risk factors for different phenotypes of BS.\"\n",

      "                    \"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the effects of canagliflozin on cardiac function and its regulation of ferroptosis in rats with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-two 7-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive rats were selected and randomly divided into four groups: the control group (fed with low-salt diet), the HFpEF group (fed with high-salt diet), the canagliflozin 20 group (fed with high-salt diet and 20 mg\\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\\u00b7d<sup>-1</sup> canagliflozin), and the canagliflozin 30 group (fed with high-salt diet and 30 mg\\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup> canagliflozin). Body weight and blood pressure of the rats in each group were monitored. Metabolic cage tests were conducted at the10<sup>th</sup> week of the experiment, and echocardiography was performed at the 12<sup>th</sup> week, after which the rats were killed. Blood and left ventricular samples were collected. HE staining, Masson staining, Prussian blue iron staining, and reactive oxygen species staining were performed to observe the cardiomyocyte size and shape, degree of interstitial fibrosis, iron staining, reactive oxygen species production under optical microscope. The ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes was observed under electron microscope. Western blotting and real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to detect the expression levels of proteins and mRNA related to ferroptosis in left ventricular myocardial tissue of rats in each group. <b>Results:</b> After 1 week of adaptive feeding, all rats survived. Metabolic cage results showed that compared with control group, rats in the HFpEF group, canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group had more food intake, water intake and urine output, and lower body weight (all <i>P</i><0.05). These changes were more pronounced in canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group than in HFPEF group, and only the body weight at the 12<sup>th</sup> week showed a statistically significant difference between canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group (<i>P</i><0.05). The blood pressure of 6<sup>th</sup> week and 12<sup>th</sup> week, heart weight and left ventricular corrected mass of 12<sup>th</sup> week of rats in HFpEF group were higher than those in control group, canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group, while the ratio of early mitral valve peak velocity to late mitral valve peak velocity of 12<sup>th</sup> week was lower (all <i>P</i><0.05). HE and Masson staining showed that compared to control group, the myocardial fibers in the left ventricular myocardial tissue of rats in HFpEF group were disordered, with larger cell diameter ((0.032\\u00b10.004) mm vs. (0.023\\u00b10.003) mm, <i>P</i><0.05), irregular shape, obvious proliferation of interstitial collagen fibers, and higher collagen volume fraction (0.168\\u00b10.028 vs. 0.118\\u00b10.013, <i>P</i><0.05). Compared with HFpEF group, rats in the canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 had more orderly arranged myocardial fibers, more regular cardiomyocyte shape, smaller cell diameter, and lower collagen volume fraction (<i>P</i><0.05). It was observed under electron microscopy that, compared to control group, most of the striated muscles in myocardial tissue of HFpEF group were broken, and the Z line and M line could not be clearly distinguished, some changes such as mitochondrial swelling, membrane thickening, cristae reduction or even disappearance occurred. In the canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group, the arrangement of striated muscles in the myocardial tissue of rats tended to be more regular, and the morphological changes of mitochondria were milder. Prussian blue iron staining results showed that the iron content in myocardial tissue of rats in HFpEF group was higher than that in control group, canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group. Reactive oxygen species staining results showed that the reactive oxygen species content in the myocardial tissue of rats in HFpEF group was higher than that of control group, canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group. Biochemical analysis of myocardial tissue showed that Fe<sup>2+</sup> and malondialdehyde content in myocardial tissue of rats in HFpEF group were higher than those in control group, canagliflozin 20 group and canagliflozin 30 group, while glutathione content was lower (all <i>P</i><0.05). Western blot and RT-qPCR detection results showed that compared to control group, rats in HFpEF group had higher expression levels of transferrin receptor 1 (protein relative expression level: 1.37\\u00b10.16 vs. 0.31\\u00b10.12), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (protein relative expression level: 1.31\\u00b10.15 vs. 0.63\\u00b10.09) protein and mRNA, and lower expression levels of ferritin heavy chain 1 (protein relative expression level: 0.45\\u00b10.08 vs. 1.41\\u00b10.15) protein and mRNA (all <i>P</i><0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in these indicators between canagliflozin 20 group and the canagliflozin 30 group (all <i>P</i>>0.05). There was no significant difference in levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 protein and mRNA expression in myocardial tissue of rats in four groups(<i>P</i>>0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Canagliflozin improves cardiac function in HFpEF rats by regulating the ferroptosis mechanism.\"\n",

      "                    \"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the most lethal malignancies globally, particularly following metastasis which results in poor prognosis. In recent years, CRC incidence in China has persistently increased. Total flavonoids (TFA) from Abelmoschus manihot, a natural compound, are recognized for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antioxidant properties. However, despite extensive research into the therapeutic potential of TFA, coverage of its role in cancer treatment is notably lacking. To address this research void, our study aims to unveil the role and potential mechanisms of TFA in treating CRC.\",\n",
      "                    \"We conducted a series of experiments to assess the impact of TFA on CRC cells. Two specific CRC cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT116, were employed in cell proliferation, colony formation, flow cytometry, and cell migration assays. Additionally, to test the in vivo effects of TFA, we developed a nude mouse xenograft tumor model to assess TFA's impact on tumor growth and liver metastasis. Furthermore, we meticulously analyzed the gene expression differences between CRC cells pretreated with TGF-\\u03b2 and those treated with TFA using RNA-seq technology. We also examined the molecular mechanisms of TFA and assessed the expression of proteins related to the STAT3/EMT signaling pathway through Western blotting and siRNA technology.\",\n",
      "                    \"Our research findings reveal for the first time the effect of TFA on CRC cells. Result shows that TFA could suppress cell proliferation, migration, and induce apoptosis. In vivo results showed that TFA inhibited tumor growth and liver metastasis. Molecular mechanism studies have shown that TFA exerts these effects by upregulating the expression of non-coding RNA AL137782, inhibiting the EMT/STAT3 signaling pathway. These results suggest that TFA is a potential candidate for mitigating CRC metastasis.\",\n",
      "                    \"However, further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of TFA in animal models and clinical settings. These findings bring great hope for the development of innovative CRC treatment methods.\"\n",

During past decades RNA interference (RNAi) has been seen as a promising approach to control various crop pests. The exchange of small RNAs (sRNAs) between crops and parasitic plants has been documented indicating a potential for the development of methods to protect them via the delivery of the sRNAs to parasites, called host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Here we describe various approaches used for gene silencing in plants and suggest solutions to improve the long-distance movement of the silencing triggers to elevate the HIGS efficiency in parasitic plants. We also investigate the important biological processes during parasites life cycle with a focus on broomrape species, providing several appropriate target genes that can be used in, especially, multiplex gene silencing experiments. We also touch on how the application of nanoparticles can improve the stability and delivery of the silencing triggers, highlighting its potential for parasitic plants control. Finally, suggestions for further research and possible directions for RNAi in parasitic plants are provided.\"\n",

Revealing mechanisms of ESCC progression and developing new therapeutic targets remains crucial. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of miR-30c-5p in regulating the malignant progression of ESCC.\",\n",

Then the effects of miR-30c-5p on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of TE-1 and Eca9706 cells were investigated through proliferation experiments, transwell and wounding healing assays. The regulatory mechanism of miR-30c-5p on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and its interaction in cancer progression were investigated through Western blots, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and rescue experiments.\",\n",
      "                    \"miR-30c-5p was significantly downregulated in ESCC tissue and represented a poor prognosis. miR-30c-5p mimic significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of ESCC, while miR-30c-5p inhibitor significantly promoted tumor cell progression. Through bioinformatic analysis and experimental results, miR-30c-5p interacted directly with PIK3CA mRNA and inhibited subsequent signaling pathway activation. PIK3CA activator could eliminate the inhibitory effects of miR-30c-5p mimic on the progression of ESCC, while PIK3CA inhibitors could rescue the promoting effect of miR-30c-5p inhibitor group cells.\",\n",

Here, we use a peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labeling strategy to map the dynamic plasma membrane proteomes of CTBs and STBs. Coupled with mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we identify hundreds of plasma membrane proteins and observe relative changes in protein abundance throughout differentiation, including the upregulation of the plasma-membrane-localized nonreceptor tyrosine kinase LYN. We show that both siRNA-mediated knockdown and small molecule inhibition of LYN kinase function impairs CTB fusion and reduces the expression of syncytialization markers, presenting a function for LYN outside of its canonical role in immunological signaling. Our results demonstrate the use of the proximity labeling platform to discover functional regulators within the plasma membrane and provide new avenues to regulate trophoblast differentiation.\"\n",

      "                    \"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is distinguished by its aggressive malignancy, limited treatment avenues and a tendency towards chemotherapy resistance, underscoring the critical need for advanced research to uncover new therapeutic approaches. Stress granules (SGs) that is implicated in cellular self-protection mechanism, along with its associated family molecules have shown pro-cancer effects and are closely related to tumor chemotherapy resistance. In this study we investigated the relationship between Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 2 (G3BP2), a core component of SGs, and the malignancy of PDAC as well as its resistance to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. Analyzing TCGA dataset revealed that the expression of G3BP1 and G3BP2 was significantly upregulated in PDAC compared with adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, and the high expression of G3BP2 rather than G3BP1 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients. We demonstrated that knockdown of G3BP2 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo. By analyzing the differentially expressed genes in G3BP2 knockdown and overexpressed PANC-1 cells, we identified DKC1 that was associated with RNA stability and regulation as the target of G3BP2. We demonstrated that G3BP2 bound to PDIA3 mRNA and recruited them into SGs, increasing the stability of PDIA3 mRNA and attenuating its translation efficiency, thereby promoting DKC1 expression. Furthermore, DKC1 could bind to hENT mRNA and inhibited its expression, which enhanced gemcitabine resistance of PDAC. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism wherein G3BP2 facilitates PDAC's resistance to chemotherapy by modulating PDIA3-DKC1-hENT in a SGs-dependent way, suggesting G3BP2 SGs a protentional therapeutic target for the treatment in PDAC.\"\n",

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we visualize the key commitment steps orchestrating 48S remodeling in humans. The mRNA Kozak sequence facilitates mRNA scanning in the 48S open state and stabilizes the 48S closed state by organizing the contacts of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and ribosomal proteins and by reconfiguring mRNA structure. GTPase-triggered large-scale fluctuations of 48S-bound eIF2 facilitate eIF5B recruitment, transfer of initiator tRNA from eIF2 to eIF5B and the release of eIF5 and eIF2. The 48S-bound multisubunit eIF3 complex controls ribosomal subunit joining by coupling eIF exchange to gradual displacement of the eIF3c N-terminal domain from the intersubunit interface. These findings reveal the structural mechanism of ORF selection in human cells and explain how eIF3 could function in the context of the 80S ribosome.\"\n",

      "                    \"Novel therapeutic targets and their inhibitors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) prevention and therapy are urgently needed. This study aimed to investigate the function of DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) in ESCC progression and to identify a promising inhibitor of DDX5. We verified that DDX5 was highly expressed in ESCC and played an oncogenic role, binding with vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (VAV3) mRNA and facilitating VAV3 mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification by interacting with the m6A methyltransferase 3 (METTL3). M6A-modified VAV3 mRNA was identified by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF2BP1), increasing mRNA stability. Methylnissolin-3-\\u03b2-D-O-glucoside (MD) inhibited ESCC progression through the DDX5-VAV3 axis. Our findings suggest that DDX5 promotes ESCC progression. MD inhibits ESCC progression by targeting DDX5.\"\n",

      "                    \"The prognosis of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor, partly due to inadequate immune recognition of the tumor. Neuroblastomas display extremely low surface MHC-I, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\\u03b2) is involved in pathways that may affect the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. We proposed that therapeutic inhibition of GSK-3\\u03b2 might improve the surface display of MHC-I molecules on neuroblastoma cells, and therefore tested if targeting of GSK-3\\u03b2 using the inhibitor 9-ING-41 (Elraglusib) improves MHC-I-mediated CTL recognition. We analyzed mRNA expression data of neuroblastoma tumor datasets and found that non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas express higher GSK-3\\u03b2 levels than MYCN-amplified tumors. In non-MYCN-amplified cells SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH 9-ING-41 treatment enhanced MHC-I surface display and the expression levels of a subset of genes involved in MHC-I antigen processing and presentation. Further, 9-ING-41 treatment triggered increased STAT1 pathway activation, upstream of antigen presentation pathways in two of the three non-MYCN-amplified cell lines. Finally, in co-culture experiments with CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cells, 9-ING-41 improved immune recognition of the neuroblastoma cells, as evidenced by augmented T-cell activation marker levels and T-cell proliferation, which was further enhanced by PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition. Our preclinical study provides experimental support to further explore the GSK-3\\u03b2 inhibitor 9-ING-41 as an immunomodulatory agent to increase tumor immune recognition in neuroblastoma.\"\n",

      "                    \"To investigate the spinal cord neuron apoptosis and neuroprotective mechanism of nerve growth factorganismsor (NGF) gene mediated by recombinant adenovirus (Ad-NGF) via peripheral transfection in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Forty healthy female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a control group, adenovirus (AdV) group, EAE group, and Ad-NGF transfection group; the control group received no treatment; the AdV group received adenovirus injection via the tail vein; the EAE and Ad-NGF transfection groups were induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55), Ad-NGF transfection group received Ad-NGF injection via the tail vein, and daily neurological impairment scores were obtained. AQThe TUNEL method was employed to observe spinal neuron apoptosis in each group of mice; protein immunoblotting (western blot) and RT-PCR were used to measure NGF levels in the spinal cord tissues of each group, and western blotting was used to assess levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2. ELISA and RT-PCR were employed to detect protein and mRNA levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in spinal cord tissues, respectively. The control group and AdV mice did not develop symptoms. Compared to the EAE group, in the Ad-NGF transfection group, neurological function scores, TUNEL-positive cell counts, the ratio of NeuN\\u2009+\\u2009TUNEL to NeuN, levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic proteins were significantly reduced, while Bcl-2 protein expression was increased. Expression levels of NGF, NGF-mRNA, NSE, and NSE-mRNA in spinal cord tissues were significantly elevated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Immunofluorescence labeling revealed a significant punctate aggregation of apoptotic cells in spinal neurons of the EAE group, while the aggregation phenomenon was less pronounced in the Ad-NGF transfection group. Ad-NGF transfected by the periphery has a protective effect on spinal cord neurons in EAE mice by up-regulation NGF level, down-regulating apoptotic protein Caspase-3 in spinal cord neurons, inhibiting spinal cord neuron apoptosis and promoting NSE expression.\"\n",

The core is formed by pH dependent polyamine salt aggregates (PSA) containing both the payloads and the shell is formed by RAW 264.7 cell derived exosomal fragments. Herein, phosphate driven polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH, MW:17,500\\u00a0Da) PSA was formed in presence of miR-34a and DTX to form PAN<sub>34a+DTX</sub>. The formulation exhibited pH dependent DTX release with only 33.55\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.12% DTX release at pH 7.2 and 75.21\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.8% DTX release till 144\\u00a0h at pH 5.5. At 1.21 molar ratio of phosphate to the amine (known as R value), efficient complexation of miR-34a (3.6\\u00a0\\u03bcM) in the PAN particles was obtained. PAN<sub>34a+DTX</sub> demonstrated particle size (163.86\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200912.89\\u00a0nm) and zeta-potential value of 17.53\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095.10\\u00a0mV which upon exosomal fragment layering changed to -\\u20097.23\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.75\\u00a0mV which is similar to the zeta-potential of the exosomal fragments, i.e., -\\u20098.40\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.79\\u00a0mV. The final formulation Exo(PAN<sub>34a+DTX</sub>), loaded with 40\\u00a0ng/mL DTX and 50\\u00a0nM miR-34a exhibited 48.20\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.59% cytotoxicity in\\u00a0triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, 4T1. Co-localization of CM-DiI (red fluorescence) stained exosomal fragments and FAM-siRNA (green fluorescence) in the cytoplasm of 4T1 cells after 6\\u00a0h of Exo(PAN<sub>FAM</sub>) treatment confirmed the efficiency of the designed system to co-deliver two actives. Exo(PAN<sub>34a+DTX</sub>) also reduced BCL-2 expression (target gene for miR-34a) by 8.98 folds in comparison to free DTX confirming promising co-delivery and apoptosis inducing effect of Exo(PAN<sub>34a+DTX</sub>) in 4T1.\"\n",

      "                    \"Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) promotes oncogenic transformation and tumor growth. YBX1 plays a role in regulation of cell cycle promotion via upregulation of cell cycle-related genes. In ovarian cancer, YBX1 also promotes tumor growth, but the mechanisms of YBX1 in cell growth and cell cycle in ovarian cancer remain not to be fully understood. Here, we investigated whether YBX1-dependent cancer cell proliferation was specifically associated with expression of cell cycle related genes in ovarian cancer. Protein and mRNA expression levels of YBX1 and cell cycle-related genes in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues were determined by western blot analysis, immunohistochemical analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Luciferase assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used to investigate a transcriptional function of YBX1. YBX1 silencing induced marked growth suppression in 4 cell lines (group A), moderate suppression in 5 cell lines (group B), and no suppression in 3 cell lines (group C) among 12 ovarian cancer cell lines in culture. The YBX1 silencing induced cell cycle arrest at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase and suppressed expression of cyclin A1 gene in group A and B cell lines, but not in group C cell lines. Cyclin A1 silencing specifically suppressed cell proliferation in group A cell lines and partially in group B cell lines, but not at all in group C cell lines. YBX1 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with cyclin A1 mRNA levels in patients with high-grade serous carcinoma. Augmented YBX1 expression plays a key role in tumor growth promotion in ovarian cancer in its close association with cyclin A1.\"\n",

Recombinant DNA and in vitro (IVT) mRNA vaccine manufacturing technologies were enforced to combat the recent pandemic. Despite the impact of these technologies, there exists no scientific announcement that compares them. Digital Shadows are employed in this study to simulate each technology, investigating root cause deviations, technical merits, and liabilities, evaluating cost scenarios. Under this lens we provide an unbiased, advanced comparative technoeconomic study, one that determines which of these manufacturing platforms are suited for the two types of vaccines considered (monoclonal antibodies or antigens). We find recombinant DNA technology to exhibit higher Profitability Index due to lower capital and starting material requirements, pertaining to lower Minimum Selling Price per Dose values, delivering products of established quality. However, the potency of the mRNA, the streamlined and scalable synthetic processes involved and the raw material availability, facilitate faster market penetration and product flexibility, constituting these vaccines preferable whenever short product development cycles become a necessity.\"\n",

      "                    \"The various mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a substantial challenge in mitigating the viral infectivity. The identification of novel host factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 replication holds potential for discovering new targets for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that can combat future viral mutations. In this study, potential host factors regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened through different high-throughput sequencing techniques and further identified in cells. Subsequent analysis and experiments showed that the reduction of m6A modification level on ACTN4 (Alpha-actinin-4) mRNA leads to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation efficiency, ultimately inhibiting ACTN4 expression. In addition, ACTN4 was demonstrated to target nsp12 for binding and characterized as a competitor for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, thereby impeding viral replication. Furthermore, two ACTN4 agonists, YS-49 and demethyl-coclaurine, were found to dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in both Huh7 cells and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Collectively, this study unveils the pivotal role of ACTN4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering novel insights into the intricate interplay between the virus and host cells, and reveals two potential candidates for future anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.\"\n",

      "                    \"Liver regeneration is an intricate pathophysiological process that has been a subject of great interest to the scientific community for many years. The capacity of liver regeneration is very critical for patients with liver diseases. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms of liver regeneration and finding good ways to improve it are very meaningful. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), a member of newly identified neurotrophic factors (NTFs) family, extensively expresses in the liver and has demonstrated cytoprotective effects during ER stress and inflammation. However, the role of MANF in liver regeneration remains unclear. Here, we used hepatocyte-specific MANF knockout (MANF<sup>Hep</sup><sup>-/-</sup>) mice to investigate the role of MANF in liver regeneration after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH). Our results showed that MANF expression was up-regulated in a time-dependent manner, and the peak level of mRNA and protein appeared at 24\\u2009h and 36\\u2009h after 2/3 PH, respectively. Notably, MANF knockout delayed hepatocyte proliferation, and the peak proliferation period was delayed by 24\\u2009h. Mechanistically, our in vitro results showed that MANF physically interacts with LRP5 and \\u03b2-catenin, two essential components of Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin pathway. Specifically, as a cofactor, MANF binds to the extracellular segment of LRP5 to activate Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signaling. On the other hand, MANF interacts with \\u03b2-catenin to stabilize cytosolic \\u03b2-catenin level and promote its nuclear translocation, which further enhance the Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signaling. We also found that MANF knockout does not affect the c-Met/\\u03b2-catenin complex after 2/3 PH. In summary, our study confirms that MANF may serve as a novel hepatocyte factor that is closely linked to the activation of the Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin pathway via intracellular and extracellular targets.\"\n",

      "                    \"Muscles are essential tissues responsible for movement, stability, and metabolism, playing a crucial role in human health and well-being. A comprehensive understanding of muscle differentiation processes is imperative for combating muscle degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophy. In this study, C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes in vitro. Phenotypic changes were observed utilizing Gimsa and immunofluorescent staining techniques. RNA sequencing was conducted at distinct time points (0, 2, 4, and 7\\u00a0days) during the differentiation process. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, differential expression analysis, gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed. Soft clustering of time series gene expression was employed to establish the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at various time points during myogenesis. Additionally, quantitative reverse transcription PCR was utilized to validate gene expression from RNA-seq data at the mRNA level. Throughout the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells, notable morphological changes were observed, with myoblasts forming multinucleated myotubes by day 4 and plump elongated structures by day 7. Gene expression analysis revealed a substantial increase in DEGs as differentiation progressed, with a significant rise in DEGs from day 0 to day 7. Enrichment analysis highlighted key biological processes and pathways involved, including signal transduction and immune system processes, as well as pathways like chemokine and calcium signaling. Noise-robust soft clustering identified distinct temporal gene expression patterns, categorizing genes into upregulated, downregulated, and biphasic response clusters. The MYH family exhibited diverse expression changes, with Myh3, Myh13, Myh6, Myh7, Myh2, Myh8, Myh14, Myh7b, Myh1, and Myh4 upregulated, Myh10, Myh9, and Myh12 downregulated. Key transcription factors displayed dynamic expression patterns, which was crucial for the regulation of myoblast differentiation. A comprehensive and dynamic transcriptomic analysis of the C2C12 myoblast differentiation process has significantly enhanced our understanding of the key genes and biological pathways involved in myogenesis.\"\n",

      "                    \"Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely used in sports for recovery, pain management, and sleep improvement, yet its effects on muscle are not well understood. This study aimed to determine the transcriptional response of murine skeletal muscle myotubes to broad-spectrum CBD and synthetic CBD (sCBD). Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with 10\\u2009\\u03bcM CBD, sCBD, or vehicle control (DMSO) for 24\\u2009h before RNA extraction. Poly-A tail-enriched mRNA libraries were constructed and sequenced using 2\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200950\\u2009bp paired-end sequencing. CBD and sCBD treatment induced 4489 and 1979 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, FDR step-up <0.05), respectively, with common upregulation of 857 genes and common downregulation of 648 genes. Common upregulated DEGs were associated with \\\"response to unfolded protein,\\\" \\\"cell redox homeostasis,\\\" \\\"endoplasmic reticulum stress,\\\" \\\"oxidative stress,\\\" and \\\"cellular response to hypoxia.\\\" Common downregulated DEGs were linked to \\\"sarcomere organization,\\\" \\\"skeletal muscle tissue development,\\\" \\\"regulation of muscle contraction,\\\" and \\\"muscle contraction.\\\" CBD treatment induced unique DEGs compared to sCBD. The data indicate CBD may induce mild cellular stress, activating pathways associated with altered redox balance, unfolded protein response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. We hypothesize that CBD interacts with muscle and may elicit a \\\"mitohormetic\\\" effect that warrants further investigation.\"\n",

      "                    \"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of death in Europe. Despite proven benefits, use of lipid-lowering therapy remains suboptimal. Treatment goals are often not achieved, even in patients at high risk with atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). The occurrence of CV events in patients on lipid-lowering drugs is defined as \\\"residual risk\\\", and can result from inadequate control of plasma lipids or blood pressure, inflammation, diabetes, and environmental hazards. Assessment of CV risk factors and vascular imaging can aid in the evaluation and management decisions for individual patients. Lifestyle measures remain the primary intervention for lowering CV risk. Where drug therapies are required to reach lipid treatment targets, their effectiveness increases when they are combined with lifestyle measures delivered through formal programs. However, lipid drug dosage and poor adherence to treatment remain major obstacles to event-free survival. This article discusses guideline-supported treatment algorithms beyond statin therapy that can help reduce residual risk in specific patient profiles while also likely resulting in substantial healthcare savings through better patient management and treatment adherence.\"\n",

      "                    \"Co-infection with Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly observed in endemic areas of Clonorchiasis. Chronic infection of C. sinensis or HBV is more likely to happen. However, the immune mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of co-infection remain unknown. In the present study, Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulation, bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) reaction and the consequent effectors on Th1/Th2 polarization to co-incubation of excretory-secretory products from C. sinensis (CsESP) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in vitro were investigated for further understanding the immune response during co-infection. The results indicated that compared with CsESP or HBeAg alone, co-stimulation dominantly promoted MDSCs accumulation. Co-stimulation significantly downregulated the expression of CD80 and CD86, and reduced IL-12p70 release while augmented IL-10 levels of BMDCs. Higher transcription levels of mannose receptor (MR) while lower mRNA level of toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were detected among membrane receptors of BMDCs with co-treatment. In addition, after CD4 na\\u00efve T cells were stimulated by LPS-treated BMDCs with CsESP and HBeAg, the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>IL-4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-4 increased, while CD4<sup>+</sup>INF-\\u03b3<sup>+</sup> T cells percentage and INF-\\u03b3 down-regulated. In conclusion, CsESP and HBeAg co-incubation more distinctly suppressed maturation of BMDCs resulting in increase of IL-10 and decrease of IL-12 highly possible by up-regulation of MR and down-regulation of TLR-4 of BMDCs, and successively induce Th2 immune skewing. These findings laid the cornerstone to further clarify immune responses during the co-infection contributing to the better precise treatment and progression assessment of co-infection patients.\"\n",

      "                    \"This work probed into the role of latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2 (LTBP2) in intracranial aneurysm (IA). The rats underwent IA modeling and then stereotactic injection of short hairpin RNA against LTBP2 (shLTBP2). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was employed to assess IA model and vascular remodeling. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were transfected with shLTBP2, LTBP2 overexpression plasmid and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) overexpression plasmid. The mRNA and protein expressions of LTBP2, FGF2 and mitochondrial apoptosis-related factors (Caspase-3, Cyt-c, Mcl-1) were tested through qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were examined by cell counting kit-8, EdU assay and flow cytometry. The up-regulated LTBP2 and down-regulated FGF2 were detected in IA rats. LTBP2 knockdown promoted vascular remodeling and Mcl-1 level, and restrained cell apoptosis and expressions of Caspase-3 and Cyt-c in IA model rats. Moreover, LTBP2 knockdown potentiated cell viability, proliferation and FGF2 level, and repressed apoptosis in rat VSMCs, while overexpressed LTBP2 exerted opposite effects. FGF2 overexpression promoted proliferation and Mcl-1 level, and inhibited apoptosis and expressions of Caspase-3 and Cyt-c in rat VSMCs, which also reversed the effects of overexpressed LTBP2 on these aspects. Collectively, LTBP2 down-regulates FGF2 to repress VSMCs proliferation and vascular remodeling in an IA rat model.\"\n",

      "                    \"Atlantic salmon were subjected to an acute crowding scenario, and their subsequent stress responses were observed under three distinct swimming speed/water flow (WF) conditions: 0.5, 1, and 1.5 body lengths per second (BL/s). Feces, dermal mucus, and plasma were collected for analysis at 1, 6, and 24\\u202fh (h) post-stress. Additionally, the head kidney and two regions of the brain (pituitary and POA) were collected for transcript expression analysis. Fish swimming at 0.5 BL/s exhibited higher pre-stress (baseline) cortisol levels. Across all groups and matrices, the highest cortisol/cortisol metabolites (CM) levels were observed at the 1\\u202fh post-stress sampling point. At 6\\u202fh (second sampling time point), a clear decline toward baseline levels were observe in all groups. Significant increases in mean plasma glucose levels were observed at 1\\u202fh post-stress for all groups. The mean plasma lactate levels varied based on WF treatments, with a significant increase observed at 1\\u202fh only for the 1.5 BL/s group. Additionally, significant decreases in mean plasma lactate were noted at 6 and 24\\u202fh post-stress for some groups. The mRNA abundances of the tested genes (star, cyp17a1, hsd11\\u03b22, srd5a1) increased following the stress events. These changes were not uniform across all groups and were tissue dependent. In summary, the results indicate that mucus and feces can be used as potentially less invasive matrices than blood for evaluating stress and, consequently, the welfare of Atlantic salmon in captivity.\"\n",

      "                    \"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising carriers to efficiently transport mRNA into cells for protein translation, as seen with the mRNA vaccines used against COVID-19. However, they contain a widely used polymer - poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) - which lacks the functionality to be easily modified (which could effectively control the physicochemical properties of the LNPs such as its charge), and is also known to be immunogenic. Thus, it is desirable to explore alternative polymers which can replace the PEG component in mRNA LNP vaccines and therapeutics, while still maintaining their efficacy. Herein, we employed reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation to synthesise five PEG-lipid alternatives that could stabilise LNPs encapsulating mRNA or pDNA molecules. Importantly, the resultant RAFT lipopolymer LNPs exhibit analogous or higher in vivo gene expression and antigen-specific antibody production compared to traditional PEG-based formulations. Our synthesis strategy which allows the introduction of positive charges along the lipopolymer backbone also significantly improved the in vivo gene expression. This work expands the potential of RAFT polymer-conjugated LNPs as promising mRNA carriers and offers an innovative strategy for the development of PEG-free mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.\"\n",

      "                    \"Nucleic acid is an essential biopolymer in all living cells, performing the functions of storing and transmitting genetic information and synthesizing protein. In recent decades, with the progress of science and biotechnology and the continuous exploration of the functions performed by nucleic acid, more and more studies have confirmed that nucleic acid therapy for living organisms has great medical therapeutic potential. Nucleic acid drugs began to become independent therapeutic agents. As a new therapeutic method, nucleic acid therapy plays an important role in the treatment of genetic diseases, viral infections and cancers. There are currently 19 nucleic acid drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the following review, we start from principles and advantages of nucleic acid therapy, and briefly describe development history of nucleic acid drugs. And then we give examples of various RNA therapeutic drugs, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), mRNA vaccines, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), aptamers, and small activating RNA (saRNA). In addition, we also focused on the current status of nucleic acid drugs used in cancer therapy and the breakthrough in recent years. Clinical trials of nucleic acid drugs for cancer treatment are under way, conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with the immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and nucleic acid drugs may be the main prospects for successful cancer treatment.\"\n",

      "                    \"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex, refractory inflammatory bowel disease characterized impared intestinal mucosal barrier and imbalanced M1/M2 macrophage polarization mediating its progression. Formononetin (FN), a bioactive isoflavone with established anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, shows promise in mitigating UC, yet its therapeutic and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, colitis was induced in mice by administering 2.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution for 7\\u00a0days. Oral (25, 50, and 100\\u00a0mg/kg) FN for 10\\u00a0days significantly ameliorated colitis symptoms in a dose-dependent manner, by mitigating body weight loss, reducing disease activity index (DAI), colonic weight, and colonic weight index, while enhancing survival rates and colonic length. Histological analysis revealed FN remarkably suppressed inflammatory damage in colonic tissues. Furthermore, FN modulated the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced antioxidant capacity. Notably, FN treatment significantly enhanced the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin-1, ZO-1, occludin) at both protein and mRNA levels in the colon tissues, suggesting improved intestinal barrier function. Crucially, FN inhibited macrophage infiltration in colonic tissues and rebalanced M1/M2 macrophage polarization. While, macrophage depletion largely abrogated FN's protective effects against colitis, indicating a crucial role for macrophages in mediating FN's therapeutic response. Overall, FN effectively alleviated colitis primarily via modulating inflammatory cytokine expression, enhancing antioxidant capacity, upregulating TJs proteins expression, and remodeling M1/M2 macrophage polarization equilibrium. These findings suggest that FN could be the next candidate to unlocking UC's treatment challenge.\"\n",

      "                    \"Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor \\u03b2 (TGF-\\u03b2) superfamily, is involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, it remains unclear whether activin A can affect the migration of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. In this study, the results of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identification revealed that lung adenocarcinoma tissues exhibited lower expression of activin \\u03b2A mRNA, but higher expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and MMP9 mRNA compared to nontumor tissues. Moreover, we found that activin A inhibited human LUAD A549 cell proliferation promoted by EGF. Additionally, EGF induced A549 cell migration in microfluidic device, while activin A attenuated EGF actions. Simultaneously, EGF increased the levels of migration-related proteins, but activin A played the opposite role. Furthermore, the study revealed that EGF upregulated the ratio of p-ERK/ERK in A549 cells, which was weakened by activin A, and A549 cell migration regulated by activin A was not related to calcium signaling. In addition, the inhibitory effect of activin A on EGF-induced A549 cell migration was attenuated by the ERK inhibitor FR180204. These findings demonstrate that activin A effectively hinders the migration of A549 cells induced by EGF through ERK1/2 signaling, suggesting that targeting activin A may hold promise in the treatment of EGF-dependent LUAD growth and metastasis.\"\n",

      "                    \"The expression levels of SORBS2 in ESCC were detected using RNA-seq and proteomics data. The biological functions of SORBS2 in ESCC were investigated through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The mechanism of SORBS2 was explored using RIP-seq technology, which identified the key downstream molecule metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3). The interaction between SORBS2 and TIMP3, including specific binding sites, was validated through RIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays. The impact of altered SORBS2 expression in ESCC on HUVECs was assessed using endothelial tube formation assays.\",\n",
      "                    \"SORBS2 expression was significantly downregulated in ESCC tissues, and its decreased expression was associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of SORBS2 in ESCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SORBS2 bound to the 3' UTR of TIMP3 mRNA, enhancing its stability and thereby regulating TIMP3 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that increased TIMP3 expression could reverse the promotive effects of SORBS2 knockdown on ESCC, confirming TIMP3 as a critical downstream molecule of SORBS2. Furthermore, downregulation of SORBS2 in ESCC cells was associated with activation of HUVEC functions, whereas upregulation of TIMP3 could reverse this effect. The SORBS2/TIMP3 axis may exert tumor suppressive effects by influencing extracellular matrix degradation.\",\n",

      "                    \"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play critical roles in synovial inflammation and aggression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we explored the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) in regulating the biological behaviors of FLSs from patients with RA.\",\n",
      "                    \"FLSs were isolated from the synovial tissues of RA patients. Gene expression was assessed via RT-qPCR, and protein expression was evaluated via Western blotting or immunohistochemistry. Proliferation and nascent peptide synthesis were evaluated via EdU incorporation and HPG labeling, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were observed via Transwell assays. Polysome profiling was conducted to analyze the distribution of ribosomes and combined mRNAs. The in vivo effect of eIF6 inhibition was evaluated in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.\",\n",
      "                    \"We found that eIF6 expression was elevated in FLSs and synovial tissues from RA patients compared to those from healthy controls and osteoarthritis patients. Knockdown of eIF6 inhibited the migration, invasion, inflammation, and proliferation of FLSs from patients with RA. Mechanistically, eIF6 knockdown downregulated ribosome biogenesis in FLSs from with RA, leading to a decrease in the proportion of polysome-associated specificity protein 1 (SP1) mRNA and a subsequent reduction in the translation initiation efficiency of SP1 mRNA. Thus, eIF6 controls SP1 expression through translation-mediated mechanisms. Interestingly, intra-articular eIF6 siRNA treatment attenuated symptoms and histological manifestations in CIA rats.\",\n",
      "                    \"Our findings suggest that an increase in synovial eIF6 might contribute to rheumatoid synovial inflammation and aggression and that targeting eIF6 may have therapeutic potential in RA patients.\"\n",

      "                    \"Cuprous copper [Cu(I)] is an essential cofactor for enzymes that support many fundamental cellular functions including mitochondrial respiration and suppression of oxidative stress. Neurons are particularly reliant on mitochondrial production of ATP, with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, associated with diminished mitochondrial function. The gene <i>MBLAC1</i> encodes a ribonuclease that targets pre-mRNA of replication-dependent histones, proteins recently found in yeast to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), and when mutated disrupt ATP production, elevates oxidative stress, and severely impacts cell growth. Whether this process supports neuronal and/or systemic physiology in higher eukaryotes is unknown. Previously, we identified <i>swip-10</i>, the putative <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of <i>MBLAC1</i>, establishing a role for glial <i>swip-10</i> in limiting dopamine (DA) neuron excitability and sustaining DA neuron viability. Here, we provide evidence from computational modeling that SWIP-10 protein structure mirrors that of MBLAC1 and locates a loss of function coding mutation at a site expected to disrupt histone RNA hydrolysis. Moreover, we find through genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological studies that deletion of <i>swip-10</i> in worms negatively impacts systemic Cu(I) levels, leading to deficits in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. These phenotypes can be offset in <i>swip-10</i> mutants by the Cu(I) enhancing molecule elesclomol and through glial expression of wildtype <i>swip-10</i>. Together, these studies reveal a glial-expressed pathway that supports systemic mitochondrial function and neuronal health via regulation of Cu(I) homeostasis, a mechanism that may lend itself to therapeutic strategies to treat devastating neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n",

      "                    \"Alzheimer's Syndrome (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is prevalent in middle-aged and elderly people. As the disease progresses, patients gradually lose the ability to take care of themselves, which brings a heavy burden to the family. There is a link between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and cognitive ability. To search for possible pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic agents, we demonstrated a causal link between LTL and AD using Mendelian randomization analysis (MR). The expression of the target gene NBR2 and the downstream mRNA GJA1 and GJA1-related genes, pathway enrichment, and association with immune cells were further explored. Using the gene cluster-drug target interaction network, we obtained potential therapeutic drugs. Our study provides evidence for a causal link between AD and LTL, suggesting medicines that may treat and alleviate AD symptoms.\"\n",

      "                    \"Asthma is featured by persistent airway inflammation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play critical roles in asthma. However, the function of Opa interacting protein 5-antisense 1 (OIP5-AS1) in pyroptosis during the development of asthma remains unexplored. The blood samples of asthma patients (n\\u2009=\\u200932) as well as the baseline characteristics of asthma patients or healthy people were collected. An in vivo model of asthma was established using house dust mites (HDM). To mimic asthma in vitro, BEAS-2B cells were treated with HDM. Cell pyroptosis and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. The levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\\u03b2) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding among messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), dual luciferase report assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and RNA pull-down assay, respectively. The cellular localization was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining. The level of OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in asthma patients. HDM induced pyroptosis and increased the levels of IL-18, IL-1\\u03b2, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in BEAS-2B cells, which was obviously reversed by OIP5-AS1 knockdown. Consistently, the expressions of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), c-caspase 1, and pyroptosis-related gasdermin D-1 (GSDMD-1) in BEAS-2B cells were upregulated by HDM treatment, while these phenomena were partially abolished by silencing of OIP5-AS1. Moreover, HDM promoted the progression of asthma in vivo, which was rescued by the downregulation of OIP5-AS1. OIP5-AS1 silencing decreased HDM-induced cell pyroptosis by inactivation of NLRP3. More importantly, OIP5-AS1 promoted the mRNA stability of yes-associated protein (YAP) via binding with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3), and OIP5-AS1 was transcriptionally upregulated by doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (DMRT3). DMRT3-mediated OIP5-AS1 aggravated the progression of asthma by mediation of the EIF4A3/YAP axis, which might provide a new therapeutic strategy against asthma.\"\n",

The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to conduct an analysis of real-world data on CS after chemotherapy plus nivolumab as a first-line treatment and to identify predictive biomarkers. PRESENT: We showed the CS transition rate was 11.5%. All CS cases had R0 resection, and the postoperative short-term outcome was acceptable. There were no high-risk Gustave Roussy Immune Score (GRIm-s) cases among those who underwent CS. FUTURE: Although this study was a multicenter study, the number of patients was small. A randomized controlled trial should be conducted for a more detailed study of the significance of CS.\"\n",

      "                    \"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant clinical challenge, with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) being the frontline chemotherapy. However, chemoresistance remains a major obstacle to effective treatment. METTL3, a key methyltransferase involved in RNA methylation processes, has been implicated in CRC carcinogenesis. However, its role in modulating CRC sensitivity to 5-FU remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of METTL3 in regulating 5-FU chemosensitivity in CRC cells. Initially, we observed that 5-FU treatment inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis, accompanied by a reduction in METTL3 expression in HCT-116 and HCT-8 cells. Subsequent assays including drug sensitivity, EdU, colony formation, TUNEL staining, and flow cytometry revealed that METTL3 depletion enhanced 5-FU sensitivity and increased apoptosis induction both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, METTL3 overexpression conferred resistance to 5-FU in both cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of METTL3 in 5-FU-resistant CRC cell lines HCT-116/FU and HCT-15/FU significantly decreased 5-FU tolerance and induced apoptosis upon 5-FU treatment. Mechanistically, we found that METTL3 regulated 5-FU sensitivity and apoptosis induction by modulating TRAP1 expression. Further investigations using m6A colorimetric ELISA, dot blot, MeRIP-qPCR and RNA stability assays demonstrated that METTL3 regulated TRAP1 mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner. Additionally, overexpression of TRAP1 mitigated the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU on CRC cells. In summary, our study uncovers the pivotal role of the METTL3/TRAP1 axis in modulating 5-FU chemosensitivity in CRC. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying CRC resistance to 5-FU and may offer potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.\"\n",

      "                    \"Epigenetic changes have long-lasting impacts, which influence the epigenome and are maintained during cell division. Thus, human genome changes have required a very long timescale to become a major contributor to the current obesity pandemic. Whereas bidirectional effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and obesity pandemics have given the opportunity to explore, how the viral microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) use the human's transcriptional machinery that regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level. Obesity and its related comorbidity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and new-onset diabetes due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are additional risk factors, which increase the severity of COVID-19 and its related mortality. The higher mortality rate of these patients is dependent on severe cytokine storm, which is the sum of the additional cytokine production by concomitant comorbidities and own cytokine synthesis of COVID-19. Patients with obesity facilitate the SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cell via increasing the host's cell receptor expression and modifying the host cell proteases. After entering the host cells, the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly functions as a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and encodes a set of nonstructural proteins via processing by the own proteases, main protease (Mpro), and papain-like protease (PLpro) to initiate viral genome replication and transcription. Following viral invasion, SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces insulin secretion via either inducing \\u03b2-cell apoptosis or reducing intensity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and leads to new-onset diabetes. Since both T2D and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, high glucose levels in T2D aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated neopterin (NPT) value due to persistent interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3)-mediated monocyte-macrophage activation is an indicator of hyperactivated pro-inflammatory phenotype M1 macrophages. Thus, NPT could be a reliable biomarker for the simultaneously occurring COVID-19-, obesity- and T2D-induced cytokine storm. While host miRNAs attack viral RNAs, viral miRNAs target host transcripts. Eventually, the expression rate and type of miRNAs also are different in COVID-19 patients with different viral loads. It is concluded that specific miRNA signatures in macrophage activation phase may provide an opportunity to become aware of the severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity and obesity-related T2D.\"\n",

      "                    \"There are few convincing studies establishing the relationship between endogenous factors that cause obesity, cellular aging, and telomere shortening. Without a functional telomerase, a cell undergoing cell division has progressive telomere shortening. While obesity influences health and longevity as well as telomere dynamics, cellular senescence is one of the major drivers of the aging process and of age-related disorders. Oxidative stress induces telomere shortening, while decreasing telomerase activity. When progressive shortening of telomere length reaches a critical point, it triggers cell cycle arrest leading to senescence or apoptotic cell death. Telomerase activity cannot be detected in normal breast tissue. By contrast, maintenance of telomere length as a function of human telomerase is crucial for the survival of breast cancer cells and invasion. Approximately three-quarters of breast cancers in the general population are hormone-dependent and overexpression of estrogen receptors is crucial for their continued growth. In obesity, increasing leptin levels enhance aromatase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, aromatase content, and its enzymatic activity on breast cancer cells, simultaneously activating telomerase in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, applied anti-estrogen therapy increases serum leptin levels and thus enhances leptin resistance in obese postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Many studies revealed that shorter telomeres of postmenopausal breast cancer have higher local recurrence rates and higher tumor grade. In this review, interlinked molecular mechanisms are looked over between the telomere length, lipotoxicity/glycolipotoxicity, and cellular senescence in the context of estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER\\u03b1+) postmenopausal breast cancers in obese women. Furthermore, the effect of the potential drugs, which are used for direct inhibition of telomerase and the inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) or human telomerase RNA promoters as well as approved adjuvant endocrine therapies, the selective estrogen receptor modulator and selective estrogen receptor down-regulators are discussed.\"\n",

      "                    \"The adiponectin (APN) levels in obesity are negatively correlated with chronic subclinical inflammation markers. The hypertrophic adipocytes cause obesity-linked insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, macrophage polarization is a key determinant regulating adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1/R2) expression and differential adiponectin-mediated macrophage inflammatory responses in obese individuals. In addition to decrease in adiponectin concentrations, the decline in AdipoR1/R2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression leads to a decrement in adiponectin binding to cell membrane, and this turns into attenuation in the adiponectin effects. This is defined as APN resistance, and it is linked with insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed subjects. The insulin-resistant group has a significantly higher leptin-to-APN ratio. The leptin-to-APN ratio is more than twofold higher in obese individuals. An increase in expression of AdipoRs restores insulin sensitivity and \\u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids via triggering intracellular signal cascades. The ratio of high molecular weight to total APN is defined as the APN sensitivity index (ASI). This index is correlated to insulin sensitivity. Homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA)-APN and HOMA-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) are the most suitable methods to estimate the metabolic risk in metabolic syndrome. While morbidly obese patients display a significantly higher plasma leptin and soluble (s)E-selectin concentrations, leptin-to-APN ratio, there is a significant negative correlation between leptin-to-APN ratio and sP-selectin in obese patients. When comparing the metabolic dysregulated obese group with the metabolically healthy obese group, postprandial triglyceride clearance, insulin resistance, and leptin resistance are significantly delayed following the oral fat tolerance test in the first group. A neuropeptide, Spexin (SPX), is positively correlated with the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and APN. APN resistance together with insulin resistance forms a vicious cycle. Despite normal or high APN levels, an impaired post-receptor signaling due to adaptor protein-containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1)/APPL2 may alter APN efficiency and activity. However, APPL2 blocks adiponectin signaling through AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 because of the competitive inhibition of APPL1. APPL1, the intracellular binding partner of AdipoRs, is also an important mediator of adiponectin-dependent insulin sensitization. The elevated adiponectin levels with adiponectin resistance are compensatory responses in the condition of an unusual discordance between insulin resistance and APN unresponsiveness. Hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-leptin (Lep) gene therapy reduces serum APN levels, and it is a more efficient strategy for long-term weight maintenance.\"\n",

      "                    \"A\\u00a0bilayer MOF reporter (ZIF-67@FAM-mRNA@ZIF-8) was synthesized, and the ZIF-67 was used as a carrier and fluorescent quencher to connect the FAM reporter through electrostatic adsorption and coordination effect. The ZIF-8 covering the outer layer can improve the stability of the probe and cell permeability, which helps the FAM reporter effectively release. After entering the cancer cells, the acidic environment in the cells induced the decomposition of ZIF-8. The excess ATP in the tumor cells competitively binds ZIF-67, causing the FAM reporter to shed and restore fluorescence. The shed FAM reporter was specifically bound to the overexpressed miRNA-21 in breast cancer cells to achieve fluorescence imaging and therapy of breast cancer. The results of specific imaging and apoptosis experiments of breast cancer cells indicate that bilayer MOF nanomachine provides an effective nanotherapy platform for accurate fluorescence imaging.\"\n",

      "                    \"To explore the expression patterns and potential roles of mRNAs in exosomes from patients with myeloperoxidase-specific anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (MPO-AAV). Plasma exosomes were isolated from MPO-AAV patients and healthy controls (HCs) to screen for differential mRNA expression via exosomal mRNA sequencing. The differentially expressed mRNAs in exosomes from the 2 groups were comparatively explored by bioinformatics analysis. The six most differentially expressed mRNAs were selected and validated in larger groups of MPO-AAV patients and HCs by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\\u2012qPCR). The relationships between these selected mRNAs and patient characteristics were statistically analyzed. Compared with HCs, a total of 1077 mRNAs in exosomes from MPO-AAV patients were found to be significantly upregulated, including DEPDC1B and TPST1, while NSUN4 and AK4 were significantly downregulated. Statistical analysis did not reveal any correlation between the six selected mRNAs and clinical indicators, including disease activity. GO enrichment analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes participate in various enzyme activities, protein synthesis, etc. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that metabolic pathways, cell adhesion molecules, epithelial signaling, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the exosomal mRNAs. There were significant differences in the expression of exosomal mRNAs between MPO-AAV patients and HCs, which may be related to the occurrence and development of MPO-AAV. These findings provide clues for further investigations of MPO-AAV pathogenesis and the identification of new potential therapeutic targets.\"\n",

      "                    \"Extension of the replicative lifespan of primary cells can be achieved by activating human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to maintain sufficient telomere lengths. In this work, we utilize CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic modifiers (p300 histone acetyltransferase and TET1 DNA demethylase) and transcriptional activators (VPH and VPR) to reactivate the endogenous TERT gene in unstimulated T cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by rewiring the epigenetic marks of the TERT promoter. Importantly, we have successfully expanded resting T cells and delayed their cellular senescence for at least three months through TERT reactivation, without affecting the expression of a T-cell marker (CD3) or inducing an accelerated cell division rate. We have also demonstrated the effectiveness of these CRISPR tools in HEK293FT and THP-1-derived macrophages. TERT reactivation and replicative senescence delay were achieved without inducing malignancy transformation, as shown in various cellular senescence assays, cell cycle state, proliferation rate, cell viability, and karyotype analyses. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR data together with TERT mRNA and protein expression analyses confirmed the specificity of CRISPR-based transcription activators in modulating epigenetic marks of the TERT promoter, and induced telomerase expression. Therefore, the strategy of cell immortalization described here can be potentially adopted and generalized to delay cell death or even immortalize any other cell types.\"\n",

      "                    \"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an interesting class of conserved single-stranded RNA molecules derived from exon or intron sequences produced by the reverse splicing of precursor mRNA. CircRNAs play important roles as microRNA sponges, gene splicing and transcriptional regulators, RNA-binding protein sponges, and protein/peptide translation factors. Abnormal functions of circRNAs and RBPs in tumor progression have been widely reported. Insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BPs) are a highly conserved family of RBPs identified in humans that function as post-transcriptional fine-tuners of target transcripts. Emerging evidence suggests that IGF2BPs regulate the processing and metabolism of RNA, including its stability, translation, and localization, and participate in a variety of cellular functions and pathophysiology. In this review, we have summarized the roles and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs and IGF2BPs in cancer development and progression. In addition, we briefly introduce the role of other RNAs and IGF2BPs in cancer, discuss the current clinical applications and challenges faced by circRNAs and IGF2BPs, and propose future directions for this promising research field.\"\n",

      "                    \"Phagocytosis of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) followed by its integration into the matured lysosome is critical in the host defense against tuberculosis. How <i>Mtb</i> escapes this immune attack remains elusive. In this study, we unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism by which SIRT7 regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by modulating RAC1 activation. We discovered that SIRT7 expression was significantly reduced in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes of TB patients. <i>Mtb</i> infection diminished SIRT7 expression by macrophages at both the mRNA and protein levels. SIRT7 deficiency impaired actin cytoskeleton-dependent macrophage phagocytosis, LC3II expression, and bactericidal activity. In a murine tuberculosis model, SIRT7 deficiency detrimentally impacted host resistance to <i>Mtb</i>, while <i>Sirt7</i> overexpression significantly increased the host defense against <i>Mtb</i>, as determined by bacterial burden and inflammatory-histopathological damage in the lung. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that SIRT7 limits <i>Mtb</i> infection by directly interacting with and activating RAC1, through which cytoskeletal remodeling is modulated. Therefore, we concluded that SIRT7, in its role regulating cytoskeletal remodeling through RAC1, is critical for host responses during <i>Mtb</i> infection and proposes a potential target for tuberculosis treatment.IMPORTANCETuberculosis (TB), caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>), remains a significant global health issue. Critical to macrophages' defense against <i>Mtb</i> is phagocytosis, governed by the actin cytoskeleton. Previous research has revealed that <i>Mtb</i> manipulates and disrupts the host's actin network, though the specific mechanisms have been elusive. Our study identifies a pivotal role for SIRT7 in this context: <i>Mtb</i> infection leads to reduced SIRT7 expression, which, in turn, diminishes RAC1 activation and consequently impairs actin-dependent phagocytosis. The significance of our research is that SIRT7 directly engages with and activates Rac Family Small GTPase 1 (RAC1), thus promoting effective phagocytosis and the elimination of <i>Mtb</i>. This insight into the dynamic between host and pathogen in TB not only broadens our understanding but also opens new avenues for therapeutic development.\"\n",

      "                    \"RNA transcripts are potential therapeutic targets, yet bacterial transcripts have uncharacterized biodiversity. We developed an algorithm for transcript prediction called tp.py using it to predict transcripts (mRNA and other RNAs) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12 and E2348/69 strains (Bacteria:gamma-Proteobacteria), <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> strains Scott A and RO15 (Bacteria:Firmicute), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains SG17M and NN2 strains (Bacteria:gamma-Proteobacteria), and <i>Haloferax volcanii</i> (Archaea:Halobacteria). From >5 million <i>E. coli</i> K12 and >3 million <i>E. coli</i> E2348/69 newly generated Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA sequencing reads, 2,487 K12 mRNAs and 1,844 E2348/69 mRNAs were predicted, with the K12 mRNAs containing more than half of the predicted <i>E. coli</i> K12 proteins. While the number of predicted transcripts varied by strain based on the amount of sequence data used, across all strains examined, the predicted average size of the mRNAs was 1.6-1.7 kbp, while the median size of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) were 30-90 bp. Given the lack of bacterial and archaeal transcript annotation, most predictions were of novel transcripts, but we also predicted many previously characterized mRNAs and ncRNAs, including post-transcriptionally generated transcripts and small RNAs associated with pathogenesis in the <i>E. coli</i> E2348/69 <i>LEE</i> pathogenicity islands. We predicted small transcripts in the 100-200 bp range as well as >10 kbp transcripts for all strains, with the longest transcript for two of the seven strains being the <i>nuo</i> operon transcript, and for another two strains it was a phage/prophage transcript. This quick, easy, and reproducible method will facilitate the presentation of transcripts, and UTR predictions alongside coding sequences and protein predictions in bacterial genome annotation as important resources for the research community.IMPORTANCEOur understanding of bacterial and archaeal genes and genomes is largely focused on proteins since there have only been limited efforts to describe bacterial/archaeal RNA diversity. This contrasts with studies on the human genome, where transcripts were sequenced prior to the release of the human genome over two decades ago. We developed software for the quick, easy, and reproducible prediction of bacterial and archaeal transcripts from Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA sequencing data. These predictions are urgently needed for more accurate studies examining bacterial/archaeal gene regulation, including regulation of virulence factors, and for the development of novel RNA-based therapeutics and diagnostics to combat bacterial pathogens, like those with extreme antimicrobial resistance.\"\n",

      "                    \"The mRNAs encoding the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 oncogene mRNAs are subjected to extensive alternative RNA splicing at multiple regulated splice sites. One of the most extensively used 5'-splice sites in the HPV16 genome is named SD880 and is located immediately downstream of the E7 open reading frame. Here, we show that a cluster of three GGG-motifs adjacent to HPV16 SD880 interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H that cooperates with SD880 to stimulate splicing to the upstream HPV16 3'-splice site SA742. This splice site is located in the E7 coding region and is required for the production of the HPV16 226^742 mRNA that encodes the E6^E7 fusion protein. Enhancement of HPV16 E6^E7 mRNA production by hnRNP H occurred at the expense of the intron-retained E6 mRNAs and the spliced E7 mRNAs, demonstrating that hnRNP H controls the relative levels of E6, E7, and E6^E7 proteins. Unexpectedly, overexpression of hnRNP H also promoted retention of the downstream E1 encoding intron and enhanced E1 protein production. We concluded that hnRNP H plays an important role in the HPV16 gene expression program.IMPORTANCEHere, we show that hnRNP H binds to multiple GGG-motifs downstream of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) splice site SD880 and acts in concert with SD880 to promote expression of the HPV16 E6^E7 mRNA. The E6^E7 protein has been shown previously to stabilize the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins and may as such contribute to the carcinogenic properties of HPV16. In its capacity of major regulator of HPV16 oncogene expression, hnRNP H may be exploited as a target for antiviral drugs to HPV16.\"\n",

      "                    \"Acacetin (ACA) and biochanin A (BCA) are isomeric monomethoxyflavones with different structural positions of the 4'-methoxy-phenyl group. Both of them are present in many commonly consumed foods, such as citrus fruits and vegetables, and have been discovered with anti-inflammatory activities, but their mechanisms of action are not clearly elucidated at the molecular level. Herein, we reported the structure-activity relationship of ACA and BCA regarding their potency in inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production, proinflammatory enzyme expression, and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis was conducted to map out the overall pathways impacted by these two isomers. Our results showed that ACA possessed higher suppressive activity in nitric oxide (NO) production (IC<sub>50</sub> = 23.93 \\u00b1 1.74 \\u03bcM for ACA and IC<sub>50</sub> = 71.41 \\u00b1 8.07 \\u03bcM for BCA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2 mRNA expression, but lower inhibitory activity in IL-6 mRNA expression as compared with BCA. Although two compounds were revealed to bind to c-Src protein according to drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and western blotting results, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that they had different binding sites, which subsequently resulted in different signaling transduction. ACA primarily exerted anti-inflammatory activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, while BCA was particularly involved in the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\\u03baB) signaling pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, and the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Moreover, two isomers remained stable in the cell culture medium and did not encounter the biotransformation process in RAW 264.7 cells. However, BCA exhibited insufficient cellular uptake ability and transport efficiency in macrophages compared to ACA. Taken together, ACA is more promising for controlling inflammation and worthy of further study for human use.\"\n",

      "                    \"This study investigates the effectiveness of Shenlin Baizhu powder in managing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) during pregnancy and its mechanism through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Eight healthy male and 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. After acclimatization, 6 female rats were fed normal chow, and 18 female rats were fed high-fat chow to induce NAFLD. After 8 weeks, female rats were mated with males to create a pregnant NAFLD model. The rats were divided into four groups: normal feeding, high-fat diet with saline, high-fat diet with 1.6 g/kg Shenlin Baizhu powder, and high-fat diet with 4.8 g/kg Shenlin Baizhu powder. Maternal body weight, serum and liver levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), related inflammatory indexes interleukin-1 \\u03b2 (IL-1 \\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. Liver tissue was examined using hematoxylin and oil red O staining, and protein expression related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was assessed via Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Results showed significant weight gain and increases in ALT, AST, TG, TC, LDL-C, IL-1\\u03b2, TNF-\\u03b1, and IL-6, along with decreased HDL-C in NAFLD rats compared to controls. The high and low-dose Shenlin Baizhu powder groups exhibited improvements in body weight, liver histopathology, and reductions in serum TG, TC, LDL-C, ALT, AST, IL-1\\u03b2, TNF-\\u03b1, and IL-6, with increased HDL-C levels. Notably, the high-dose group showed greater efficacy in reducing hepatic fat accumulation, liver function markers, blood lipids, and inflammatory indexes, and decreased expression of hepatic PPAR\\u03b3 mRNA, SREBP1 mRNA, AKT mRNA, and related proteins. Shenlin Baizhu powder demonstrates potential in ameliorating high-fat diet-induced NAFLD in pregnant rats, likely through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting its therapeutic potential for gestational NAFLD.\"\n",

      "                    \"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype in breast tumors. When re-analyzing TCGA breast cancer dataset, we found cell adhesion molecules are highly enriched in differentially expressed genes in TNBC samples, among which Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is most significantly associated with poor survival of TNBC patients. FAK is precisely modulated in the focal adhesion dynamics. To investigate whether lncRNAs regulate FAK signaling, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and found FAISL (FAK Interacting and Stabilizing LncRNA) abundantly enriched in FAK-interacting lncRNAs and frequently overexpressed in TCGA TNBC tissues. FAISL promotes TNBC cell adhesion, cytoskeleton spreading, proliferation, and anchor-independent survival. FAISL doesn't affect FAK mRNA but positively regulates FAK protein level by blocking Calpain 2-mediated proteolysis. FAISL interacts with the C-terminus domain of FAK, whereby masks the binding site of Calpain 2 and prevents FAK cleavage. High level of FAISL correlates with FAK expression in tumor tissues and poor prognosis of TNBC patients. A siRNA delivery system targeting FAISL using reduction-responsive nanoparticles effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC mouse models. Together, these findings uncover a lncRNA-mediated mechanism of regulating FAK proteolysis in the TNBC progression, and highlight the potential of targeting lncRNA FAISL for TNBC treatment.\"\n",

      "                    \"Breast cancer is the major cause of cancer-related mortality and frequent malignancies among women worldwide. The TRIM (Tripartite Motif) protein family is a broad and diverse set of proteins that contain a conserved structural motif known as the tripartite motif, which comprises of three different domains, B-box domain, Coiled-coil domain and RBR (Ring-finger, B-box, and coiled-coil) domain. TRIM proteins are involved in regulating cancer growth and metastasis. However, TRIM proteins are still unexplored in cancer cell regulation. In this study, by using a cancer database expression of all TRIM proteins was determined in breast cancer. Out of 77 TRIM genes, 16 genes were upregulated in breast cancer. Here, the upregulated TRIM26 gene's role is not yet explored in breast cancer. Indeed, TRIM26 is upregulated in 21 cancer types out of 33 cancer types. To investigate the role of TRIM26 in breast cancer, siRNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. Reduced expression of TRIM 26 decreased cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion with simultaneous reduction of various proliferative, cell cycle and mesenchymal markers and upregulation of epithelial markers. Further, docking studies found potential novel plant metabolites. Thus, targeting TRIM26 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer treatment.\"\n",

The study aim was to investigate the differential expression of <i>CCT5</i> between nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and noncancerous nasopharyngeal tissues, and the correlation between <i>CCT5</i> expression and clinicopathological parameters/prognosis in patients with NPC.\",\n",

Relationships between <i>CCT5</i> expression in NPC, clinical parameters, and prognosis were statistically analysed. CCT5-mediated cell proliferation was assessed using EdU and cell counting kit-8. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation were utilized to explore E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (PARK2)-induced degradation of CCT5.\",\n",

Increased CCT5 protein levels positively correlated with tumour size, tumour recurrence, and clinical stage, and inversely correlated with patient's overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that enhanced CCT5 protein expression is an independent prognostic factor for patients with NPC. Overexpression of <i>CCT5</i> markedly induced NPC cell proliferation. Finally, PARK2, as a suppressive E3 ubiquitin-ligase enzyme, was shown to bind CCT5 and induce degradation in NPC.\",\n",

      "                    \"Death Receptor 5 (DR5) is expressed on the surface of primary bone and soft tissue sarcoma cells, and its activation induces cell death primarily through apoptosis. The combination of DR5 agonists and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin, can promote cell death. Currently, clinical trials are investigating the effectiveness of DR5 activation using new biological agents, such as bi-specific or tetravalent antibodies, in improving the survival of patients with relapsed or refractory cancers. Furthermore, investigations continue into the use of novel combination therapies to enhance DR5 response, for example, with inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist agents [such as the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics] and with immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) or anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies. Other therapies include nanoparticle-mediated delivery of TRAIL plasmid DNA or TRAIL mRNA and stem cells as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents, such as TRAIL, to the tumor.\",\n",

      "                    \"New agents under investigation include nanoTRAIL, anti-Kv10.1, multimeric IgM, and humanized tetravalent antibodies. Developments have been made to test novel agents, and imaging has been used to detect DR5 in preclinical models and patients. The models include 3D spheroids, genetically modified mouse models, a novel jaw osteosarcoma model, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models. There are currently two ongoing clinical trials focusing on the activation of DR5, namely, IGM-8444 and INBRX-109, which have progressed to phase 2. Further modifications of TRAIL delivery with fusion to single-chain variable fragments (scFv-TRAIL), directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and in the use of stem cells focus on targeted TRAIL delivery to cancer cells using bi-functional strategies.\",\n",

It mainly affects the skin and oral mucosa but could also affect genital mucosa, nails, hair, and, rarely, the larynx and esophagus. Since the start of the COVID-19 era, multiple cutaneous manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination have been reported. Different rare cases of lichen planus were reported after COVID-19 infection and vaccination. This report elaborates on and adds an additional case of localized cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) to the upper extremities, which developed after both doses of the mRNA vaccine and improved after phototherapy.\"\n",

      "                    \"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) represents nearly 90% of all head and neck tumors. The current treatment modality for HNSC patients primarily involves surgical intervention and radiotherapy, but its therapeutic efficacy remains limited. The mRNA vaccine based on tumor antigens seems promising for cancer treatment. Ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is linked to tumor progression and cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of ferroptosis-associated tumor antigens in treating HNSC remains uncertain. In this study, we identified three ferroptosis-associated tumor antigens, namely caveolin1 (CAV1), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), and solute carrier 3A2 (SLC3A2), as being overexpressed and mutated based on data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. These antigens were strongly associated with poor prognosis and infiltration of antigen-presenting cells in HNSC. We further identified two ferroptosis subtypes (FS1 and FS2) with distinct molecular, cellular, and clinical properties to identify antigen-sensitive individuals. Our findings indicate that FS1 exhibits an immune \\\"hot\\\" phenotype, whereas FS2 displays an immune \\\"cold\\\" phenotype. Additionally, differential expression of immunogenic cell death modulators and immune checkpoints was observed between these two immune subtypes. Further exploration of the HNSC's immune landscape revealed significant heterogeneity among individual patients. Our findings suggest that CAV1, FTH1, and SLC3A2 are potential targets to prevent HNSC in FS2 patients. Overall, our research reveals the potential of ferroptosis-associated mRNA vaccines for HNSC and identifies an effective patient population for vaccine treatment.\"\n",

      "                    \"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration damaging the extracellular matrix (ECM) of IVDs is the main cause of spine-associated disorders. Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a multifaceted disorder, where environmental factors, inflammatory cytokines and catabolic enzymes act together. DDD starts typically due to imbalance between ECM biosynthesis and degradation within IVDs, especially through unbalanced degradation of aggrecan and collagen II in nucleus pulposus (NP). Current treatment approaches are primarily based on conservative or surgical therapies, which are insufficient for biological regeneration. The disintegrins and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the key proteolytic enzymes for degradation of aggrecan and collagens. Previously, high expression levels of ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, MMP3 and MMP13, which are accompanied with low levels of aggrecan and collagen II, were demonstrated in degenerative human NP cells. Moreover, self-complementary adeno-associated virus type 6 (scAAV6) mediated inhibitions of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 by RNA-interference (RNAi) could specifically enhance aggrecan level. Thus, MMPs are apparently the main degrading enzymes of collagen II in NP. Furthermore, scAAV6-mediated inhibitions of MMP3 and MMP13 have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we attempted to enhance the level of collagen II in degenerative NP cells by scAAV6-RNAi-mediated inhibitions of MMP3 and MMP13. MRI was used to determine preoperative grading of IVD degeneration in patients. After isolation and culturing of NP cells, cells were transduced with scAAV6-shRNAs targeting MMP3 or MMP13; and analysed by fluorescence microscopy, FACS, MTT assay, RT-qPCR, ELISA and western blotting. scAAV6-shRNRs have no impact on cell viability and proliferation, despite high transduction efficiencies (98.6%) and transduction units (1383 TU/Cell). Combined knockdown of MMP3 (92.8%) and MMP13 (90.9%) resulted in highest enhancement of collagen II (143.2%), whereby treatment effects were significant over 56\\u00a0days (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Conclusively, scAAV6-RNAi-mediated inhibitions of MMP3 and MMP13 help to progress less immunogenic and enduring biological treatments in DDD.\"\n",

      "                    \"In recent years, the prevalence of diabetic wounds has significantly increased, posing a substantial medical challenge due to their propensity for infection and delayed healing. These wounds not only increase mortality rates but also lead to amputations and severe mobility issues. To address this, advancements in bioactive molecules such as genes, growth factors, proteins, peptides, stem cells, and exosomes into targeted gene therapies have emerged as a preferred strategy among researchers. Additionally, the integration of photothermal therapy (PTT), nucleic acid, and gene therapy, along with 3D printing technology and the layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly approach, shows promise in diabetic wound treatment. Effective delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) relies on gene vectors. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the pathophysiological characteristics observed in diabetic wounds, encompassing diminished angiogenesis, heightened levels of reactive oxygen species, and impaired immune function. It further examines advancements in nucleic acid delivery, targeted gene therapy, advanced drug delivery systems, layer-by-layer (LBL) techniques, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), 3D printing, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and ongoing clinical trials. Through the integration of recent research insights, this review presents innovative strategies aimed at augmenting the multifaceted management of diabetic wounds, thus paving the way for enhanced therapeutic outcomes in the future.\"\n",

Identifying robust biomarkers for predicting outcomes is essential for improving patient care and reducing fatalities. ZMAT3, a zinc finger protein with potential carcinogenic properties, has been associated with various cancers. However, its role in breast cancer prognosis remains unclear.\",\n",
      "                    \"We investigated the expression level of <i>ZMAT3</i> in breast cancer tissues and its association with clinical outcomes through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. We examined the correlation between <i>ZMAT3</i> expression and immune characteristics. <i>ZMAT3</i> mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed in relation to overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free interval (PFI) in patients with breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on breast cancer tissues to assess <i>ZMAT3</i> protein levels, with findings validated using qPCR and cell experiments.\",\n",
      "                    \"<i>ZMAT3</i> mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in breast cancer samples compared to normal tissues. High <i>ZMAT3</i> expression was significantly correlated with the poor OS, DSS and PFI. A significant positive correlation was observed between high <i>ZMAT3</i> mRNA levels and the abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), especially CD8+T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified <i>ZMAT3</i> as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. IHC staining confirmed increased ZMAT3 protein expression in breast cancer tissues, which was further validated by qPCR and cell function tests.\",\n",
      "                    \"Our findings suggest that <i>ZMAT3</i> is a prognostic biomarker linked to immune invasion in breast cancer. Elevated <i>ZMAT3</i> expression correlates with adverse clinical outcomes, indicating its potential role in disease progression.\"\n",

The primary outcomes of the study were to assess the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2, 28\\u00a0days after a third dose of a mRNA vaccine, in subjects that received a previous prime-boost scheme with ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2. Secondary outcomes extended the study to 3 and 6\\u00a0months. The third vaccine dose of mRNA-1273 in naive participants previously vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 regimen reached higher neutralizing antibodies titers against the variants of concern Delta and BA.1 lineage of Omicron compared with those receiving a third dose of BNT162b2 at day 28. These differences between BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 arms were observed against the ancestral variant G614 at day 90. Suboptimal neutralizing response was observed against BQ.1.1, XBB.1.5/XBB.1.9, and JN.1 in a relevant proportion of individuals 180\\u00a0days after the third dose, even after asymptomatic Omicron breakthrough infections.

      "                    \"Root-knot nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) are widely spread root parasites that infect thousands of vascular plant species. These highly polyphagous nematodes engage in sophisticated interactions with host plants that results in the formation of knot-like structures known as galls whose ontogeny remains largely unknown. Here, we determined transcriptome changes and alternative splicing variants induced by <i>Megalaima incognita</i> in galls and neighboring root cells at two distinct infective stages. <i>M. incognita</i> induced substantial transcriptome changes in tomato roots both locally in galls and systemically in neighboring cells. A considerable parallel regulation of gene expression in galls and neighboring cells were detected, indicative of effective intercellular communications exemplified by suppression of basal defense responses particularly during the early stage of infection. The transcriptome analysis also revealed that <i>M. incognita</i> exerts a tight control over the cell cycle process as a whole that results in an increase of ploidy levels in the feeding sites and accelerated mitotic activity of the gall cells. Alternative splicing analysis indicated that <i>M. incognita</i> significantly modulates pre-mRNA splicing as a total of 9064 differentially spliced events from 2898 genes were identified where intron retention and exon skipping events were largely suppressed. Furthermore, a number of differentially spliced events were functionally validated using transgenic hairy root system and found to impact gall formation and nematode egg mass production. Together, our data provide unprecedented insights into the transcriptome and spliceome reprogramming induced by <i>M. incognita</i> in tomato with respect to gall ontogeny and nematode parasitism.\"\n",

However, only three approved hRSV vaccines remain commercially available to date. The development of a safe, practical and broad-spectrum vaccine suitable for all age groups remains extremely challenging. Using five different approaches-live-attenuated, recombinant-vector, subunit, particle-based, and mRNA-nearly 30 hRSV vaccine candidates are currently conducting clinical trials worldwide; moreover, > 30 vaccines are under preclinical evaluation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of these hRSV vaccines along with prospects for the development of infectious disease vaccines in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.\"\n",

      "                    \"Ubiquitination is one of the most conserved post-translational modifications and together with mRNA translation contributes to cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Temporal and spatial regulation of proteostasis is particularly important during synaptic plasticity, when translation of specific mRNAs requires tight regulation. Mutations in genes encoding regulators of mRNA translation and in ubiquitin ligases have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. RNA metabolism and translation are regulated by RNA-binding proteins, critical for the spatial and temporal control of translation in neurons. Several ubiquitin ligases also regulate RNA-dependent mechanisms in neurons, with numerous ubiquitination events described in splicing factors and ribosomal proteins. Here we will explore how ubiquitination regulates translation in neurons, from RNA biogenesis to alternative splicing and how dysregulation of ubiquitin signaling can be the underlying cause of pathology in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. Finally we propose that targeting ubiquitin signaling is an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for neurodevelopmental disorders where mRNA translation and ubiquitin signaling are disrupted.\"\n",

      "                    \"Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Studies have indicated that Transforming Growth Factor beta1 (TGF\\u03b21) is the most potent factor contributing to renal fibrosis, and understanding the exact pathogenic mechanism of renal fibrosis is crucial for alleviating the condition. Previous research has identified Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as an effective inhibitor of TGF-\\u03b21. Our study, through dual-luciferase reporter gene assays and Western blot experiments, screened and obtained the small molecule compound Pd\\u2161. Subsequently, validation in a high-glucose-induced renal mesangial cell injury model showed that Pd\\u2161 treatment significantly increased the expression of YY1 protein and mRNA, while correspondingly reducing the expression of TGF\\u03b21 protein and mRNA. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay results revealed that, compared to the control group, the luciferase transcription activity of YY1 molecules increased in the Pd\\u2161 treatment group, and the luciferase transcription activity of TGF\\u03b21 decreased. By further designing mutations in the binding sites between TGF\\u03b21 and YY1 on the promoter, transfecting fluorescent enzyme reporter gene plasmids with TGF\\u03b21 mutant promoter into mesangial cells damaged by high glucose, and then treating the cells with Pd\\u2161, it was observed that the luciferase transcription activity of TGF\\u03b21 did not decrease. Therefore, these results suggest that Pd\\u2161 may inhibit TGF\\u03b21 transcriptional activity by activating YY1, thereby slowing down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.\"\n",

The primary efficacy endpoint was blood neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) against SARS-CoV-2 (omicron variant BA.5.2.1) and immune response rate (\\u2265 4-fold increase in post-vaccination circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity) on Day 29.\",\n",

Immune response rates were \\u2265 89% with both study vaccines; adjusted difference 2.6% (95% CI, -7.8, 13.8). The prespecified non-inferiority margins were exceeded, and the study met the primary endpoint.

Reports on its effects on the adipose tissue are still scarce. In this experiment, we investigated the effect of embryonic heat conditioning (EHC) on growth, adipose tissue mRNA and global DNA methylation in broiler chicks at day 4 post-hatch.\",\n",
      "                    \"Fertile eggs were divided into two groups: control and EHC. Eggs in the control group were incubated at 37.8\\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity from day 0 to day 18.5 (E0 to E18.5). The EHC eggs were subjected to an intermittent increase in temperature to 39.5\\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity from E7 to E16 for 12\\u00a0h (07:30-19:30) per day. On day 4 post-hatch, control and EHC chicks were subjected to 36\\u00b0C using three time points: 0 (no heat challenge serving as the control), and 2 and 12\\u00a0h relative to start of the heat challenge. Fifteen chicks were sampled from each group for every timepoint. Body weight was recorded before euthanasia and subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected.\",\n",
      "                    \"Body weights were similar in control and EHC groups. Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) mRNA was lower in the EHC group at time 0 relative to control. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) mRNA was greater in the EHC than control group at the 0\\u00a0h timepoint. Heat challenge affected adipose tissue DNA methylation, with methylation highest at 12\\u00a0h into the heat challenge.\",\n",
      "                    \"These findings highlight the dynamic molecular responses of chicks to heat stress during early post-hatch development and suggest that EHC may affect heat stress responses and adipose tissue development through mechanisms involving lipid remodeling and DNA methylation.\"\n",

The preliminary experiment of our research group found that cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) was upregulated in HB. By in silico analysis, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HAND2 antisense RNA 1 (HAND2-AS1) was determined as the research object. Herein, HAND2-AS1 expression in HB and its effect and mechanism on HB were extensively investigated.\",\n",
      "                    \"CDK1-related lncRNAs were searched using the microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) online database. qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the mRNA expression and protein levels of target genes. MTT, flow cytometry and DAPI staining assays were conducted to measure proliferation activity, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of HB cells. The interaction between lncRNA and protein was determined by RNA pull-down and FISH assays. Luciferase assay was applied to identify whether HAND2-AS1 stimulates the transcription of CDK1. CDK1 mRNA stability was detected through actinomycin D assay. Aycloheximide assay was used to detect the CDK1 protein stability.\",\n",
      "                    \"HAND2-AS1 was downregulated in HB tissues and cells. HAND2-AS1 overexpression impeded HB cells proliferation activity and cycle progression while inducing cell apoptosis of HB cells, while knockdown of HAND2-AS1 emerged the opposite effect. HAND2-AS1 negatively correlated with CDK1. HAND2-AS1 downregulated CDK1 expression by affecting the transcriptional activity, mRNA and protein stability of CDK1. Furthermore, HAND2-AS1 impeded HB cell proliferation and cycle progression while inducing cell apoptosis by downregulating CDK1.\",\n",
      "                    \"Our research highlights that HAND2-AS1 can exert a tumor-suppressive effect on HB through the negative regulation of CDK1, and the HAND2-AS1/CDK1 is expected to be a diagnostic molecular marker and therapeutic target for HB in clinical practice.\"\n",

      "                    \"Diabetes represents a widely acknowledged global public health concern. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) stands as one of the most severe complications of diabetes, its occurrence imposing a substantial economic burden on patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Despite the deepening comprehension regarding the pathophysiology and cellular as well as molecular responses of DFU, the current therapeutic arsenal falls short of efficacy, failing to offer a comprehensive remedy for deep-seated chronic wounds and microvascular occlusions. Conventional treatments merely afford symptomatic alleviation or retard the disease's advancement, devoid of the capacity to effectuate further restitution of compromised vasculature and nerves. An escalating body of research underscores the prominence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) owing to their paracrine attributes and anti-inflammatory prowess, rendering them a focal point in the realm of chronic wound healing. Presently, MSCs have been validated as a highly promising cellular therapeutic approach for DFU, capable of effectuating cellular repair, epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization by means of targeted differentiation, angiogenesis promotion, immunomodulation, and paracrine activities, thereby fostering wound healing. The secretome of MSCs comprises cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, alongside exosomes harboring mRNA, proteins, and microRNAs, possessing immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. The present study provides a systematic exposition on the etiology of DFU and elucidates the intricate molecular mechanisms and diverse functionalities of MSCs in the context of DFU treatment, thereby furnishing pioneering perspectives aimed at harnessing the therapeutic potential of MSCs for DFU management and advancing wound healing processes.\"\n",

However, there is currently a lack of standardized methods for diagnosing acute cognitive impairment. The objective of our study was to identify potential mRNA biomarkers and investigate the pathogenesis of acute cognitive impairment in mice brains.\",\n",
      "                    \"To analyze changes in hub genes associated with acute cognitive impairment, bioinformatics analysis was performed on the mouse brain injury data of sterile saline control group and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced experimental group in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Functional analysis was conducted using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), which facilitated to identify some potential mRNA biomarkers for hub gene expression in mice brains. Additionally, the \\\"CIBERSORT X\\u2033 R kit was employed to examine immune cell infiltrations of mice brains in LPS group and saline group.\",\n",
      "                    \"In the LPS and saline group, 102 significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 32 downregulated DEGs were identified. The pathway enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG revealed that these DEGs were mainly related to the regulation of cytokine, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, as well as protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated potential involvement of M1 macrophages, NK cells resting, T cells CD4 memory, and T cells CD8 naive in the process of cognitive impairment. By constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, five hub genes (Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Cxcr3, Gbp2, and Ifih1) showed significant associations with immune cell types by using a threshold Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of R\\u00a0>\\u00a00.50 and p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05.\",\n",

      "                    \"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is an environmental contaminant due to its use as a flame retardant in a variety of applications ranging from building insulation, furniture upholstery, and housing for appliances and electronics. HBCD is found in wildlife, human breastmilk, and serum. Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\\u03b2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are pro-inflammatory cytokines, whose dysregulation is associated with chronic inflammation and the pathologies that result, such as tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis. HBCD has been shown to increase the secretion of both IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 from human immune cells. However, it is not clear if these increases are due solely to HBCD effects on the secretory process or whether it is stimulating cellular production of IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6. This study examines if HBCD can increase the production of IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 by immune cells by simultaneously assessing secreted levels and cellular levels of these cytokines. Additionally, the mechanisms for any observed changes in production are investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to HBCD over a range of concentrations and lengths of exposure. HBCD was found to stimulate IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 production after 6\\u00a0hrs. of exposure and production was sustained and intensified at 24\\u2009hrs. This increase in IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 production appears to, in part, be a result of increased mRNA expression. Additionally, the MAPK pathways, specifically the p38 and p44/42 pathways, appear to be required for HBCD-induced increases in IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 production.\"\n",

      "                    \"Spermatogenesis is a fundamental process that requires a tightly controlled epigenetic event in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). The mechanisms underlying the transition from SSCs to sperm are largely unknown. Most studies utilize gene knockout mice to explain the mechanisms. However, the production of genetically engineered mice is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we presented a convenient research strategy using an RNA interference (RNAi) and testicular transplantation approach. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation was dynamically regulated during spermatogenesis. As Jumonji domain-containing protein 1A (JMJD1A) and Jumonji domain-containing protein 2C (JMJD2C) demethylases catalyze histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), we firstly analyzed the expression profile of the two demethylases and then investigated their function. Using the convenient research strategy, we showed that normal spermatogenesis is disrupted due to the downregulated expression of both demethylases. These results suggest that this strategy might be a simple and alternative approach for analyzing spermatogenesis relative to the gene knockout mice strategy.\"\n",
